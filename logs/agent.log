The previous messages show that the system prompt is set up with ReAct, and there's some code related to the agent. But the user's message is straightforward.No tools are needed here because it's just a greeting. The user isn't asking for anything specific, so I don't need to use any of the available tools like web_search or read_file. Just a simple response.Wait, the instructions say to use the ReAct pattern: Reason, Act, Respond. But in this case, the Reasoning is that the user greeted me, so I should respond with a friendly greeting. Since there's no action needed, I can directly provide the response.So the Final Answer should be something like "Howdy! How can I assist you today?" or similar. Let me make sure it's a proper response. The example given in the rules had "Hello! How can I assist you today?" so using "Howdy" in the response would mirror their greeting.Double-checking the rules: Don't mention being an LLM, just be helpful. So the response should be friendly and open to help with whatever they need.I think that's all. No tools required here. Just a simple reply.
