2025-08-11 17:31:07,271 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - Agent thinking: Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to find the derivative of g(x) = sin(x² + 1) using the chain rule. I remember that the chain rule is used for composite functions, where you have an outer function and an inner function.First, I need to identify the outer and inner functions. Here, the outer function is sin(u) where u is the inner function. The inner function u should be x² + 1. So, g(x) = sin(u) where u = x² + 1.The chain rule states that the derivative of g with respect to x is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. So, g'(x) = cos(u) * u'.Now, let's compute u'. The inner function u = x² + 1, so its derivative u' is 2x (since the derivative of x² is 2x and the derivative of 1 is 0).Putting it all together, g'(x) = cos(x² + 1) * 2x. So the derivative should be 2x cos(x² + 1).Wait, let me double-check. The derivative of sin(u) is cos(u), and then multiply by the derivative of u. Yep, u = x² +1, so u' is 2x. So multiplying them gives 2x cos(x² +1). That seems right.I should make sure I didn't mix up any steps. Let's see: chain rule is d/dx [f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x). Here, f(u) = sin(u), so f'(u) = cos(u). Then g(x) = x² +1, so g'(x) = 2x. So yes, the derivative is cos(x² +1) * 2x. Yep, that's correct.I think that's all. No need for any tools here because it's a straightforward calculus problem. The user is asking for the derivative using chain rule, so explaining the steps and providing the answer should suffice. No need to call any tools since this is a math problem, not requiring code execution or web search. The previous knowledge mentions calculus derivatives, so maybe referencing that, but the answer is standard.So the final answer should be 2x cos(x² + 1).
2025-08-11 17:31:09,732 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - ReAct agent response: <think>Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to find the derivative of g(x) = sin(x² + 1) using the chain rule. I remember that the chain rule is used for composite functions, where you have an outer function and an inner function.First, I need to identify the outer and inner functions. Here, the outer function is sin(u) where u is the inner function. The inner function u should be x² + 1. So, g(x) = sin(u) where u = x² + 1.The chain rule states that the derivative of g with respect to x is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function multiplied by the derivative of the inner function. So, g'(x) = cos(u) * u'.Now, let's compute u'.

Let me recall how the chain rule works. The chain rule is for composite functions, right? So if you have a function inside another function, you take the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function, then multiply by the derivative of the inner function.So here, the outer function is sin(u) where u is the inner function x² + 1. The derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u). Then, I need to multiply by the derivative of u with respect to x. The derivative of u = x² + 1 is 2x.Putting that all together, the derivative g'(x) should be cos(x² + 1) * 2x, which simplifies to 2x cos(x² + 1). Let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any steps. The inner function's derivative is correct, 2x, and the outer function's derivative is cos of the inner function. Yep, that seems right.Wait, maybe I should verify using another method or check if there's a common mistake here. Sometimes people forget to multiply by the derivative of the inner function, but I remember the chain rule requires that. So cos(x² +1) times 2x is correct.I think that's it. Let me write it out step by step to confirm. Let u = x² + 1, so g(x) = sin(u). Then dg/dx = dg/du * du/dx. dg/du is cos(u), and du/dx is 2x. So substituting back, it's cos(x² +1) * 2x. Yep, that's right.I don't need any tools for this because it's a straightforward calculus problem. The user probably just needs the steps explained. So the final answer should be 2x cos(x² + 1).

Sometimes people forget to multiply by the derivative of the inner function, but I remember the chain rule requires that. So cos(x² +1) times 2x is correct.I think that's it. Let me write it out step by step to confirm. Let u = x² + 1, so g(x) = sin(u). Then dg/dx = dg/du * du/dx. dg/du is cos(u), and du/dx is 2x. So substituting back, it's cos(x² +1) * 2x. Yep, that's right.I don't need any tools for this because it's a straightforward calculus problem. The user probably just needs the steps explained. So the final answer should be 2x cos(x² + 1).</think>To find the derivative of $ g(x) = \sin(x^2 + 1) $ using the chain rule, follow these steps:1. **Identify the outer and inner functions**:   - Outer function: $ \sin(u) $   - Inner function: $ u = x^2 + 1 $2. **Apply the chain rule**:   $$   \frac{dg}{dx} = \frac{d}{du}[\sin(u)] \cdot \frac{du}{dx}   $$3. **Compute derivatives**:   - $ \frac{d}{du}[\sin(u)] = \cos(u) $   - $ \frac{du}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}[x^2 + 1] = 2x $4. **Substitute back**:   $$   \frac{dg}{dx} = \cos(x^2 + 1) \cdot 2x = 2x \cos(x^2 + 1)   $$Final Answer: The derivative is $ 2x \cos(x^2 + 1) $.

Right, the chain rule is for composite functions. So here, the outer function is sin(u) and the inner function is u = x² + 1.First, I need to remember the chain rule formula: if g(x) = f(u(x)), then g'(x) = f'(u(x)) * u'(x). So for sin(u), the derivative of sin(u) with respect to u is cos(u). Then multiply by the derivative of the inner function u.So, let's break it down. Let u = x² + 1. Then g(x) = sin(u). The derivative of sin(u) is cos(u), so that's cos(x² + 1). Then multiply by the derivative of u with respect to x. The derivative of x² + 1 is 2x. So putting it all together, g'(x) = cos(x² + 1) * 2x.Wait, let me double-check. The inner function's derivative: d/dx (x² + 1) is 2x, yes. So multiplying by the derivative of the outer function, which is cos of the inner function. So yes, 2x cos(x² + 1).I should make sure there's no mistake here. Let me recall: chain rule steps. Derivative of outer function evaluated at inner function times derivative of inner function. Yep, that's exactly what I did. So the answer should be 2x cos(x² + 1).I don't think I need to use any tools here because it's a straightforward calculus problem. The user is asking for the derivative using the chain rule, which I can compute directly. The tools provided are for code operations, web search, etc., but this is a math problem. So I should just provide the answer.Wait, but maybe I should confirm if there's any possible mistake. Let's see. If the function was sin(x)^2 + 1, that would be different, but it's sin(x² + 1), so the entire x² +1 is inside the sine. So yes, chain rule applies as I did. No issues there.So the final answer is 2x cos(x² + 1). I can write that out clearly for the user.

2025-08-11 17:35:32,645 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - Agent thinking: Okay, let's tackle this optimization problem. The problem is about finding the dimensions of a box with a square base and open top that minimizes the material used, given a volume of 32,000 cm³. First, I need to recall that the material used would correspond to the surface area of the box, since it's open at the top. So, the surface area (which we need to minimize) will be the area of the base plus the areas of the four sides.Let me define the variables. Let's say the base is a square with side length 'x' cm, and the height of the box is 'h' cm. Since the base is square, the length and width are both 'x'.The volume of the box is given by the formula Volume = base area × height. So, V = x²h. We know the volume is 32,000 cm³, so x²h = 32,000. That's our constraint equation.Now, the surface area (since it's open top) is the area of the base (x²) plus the area of the four sides. Each side has an area of x × h, so four sides would be 4xh. So total surface area S = x² + 4xh.Our goal is to minimize S, subject to the constraint x²h = 32,000.To minimize S, I should express S in terms of a single variable. Let's solve the volume equation for h: h = 32,000 / x². Then substitute this into the surface area equation.So S = x² + 4x*(32,000 / x²) = x² + (128,000 / x).Now, we need to find the minimum of S(x) = x² + 128,000/x. To find minima, take the derivative of S with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.First, compute S'(x). The derivative of x² is 2x, and the derivative of 128,000/x (which is 128,000x⁻¹) is -128,000x⁻². So S'(x) = 2x - 128,000/x².Set S'(x) = 0: 2x - 128,000/x² = 0. Let's solve for x.2x = 128,000 / x² → 2x³ = 128,000 → x³ = 64,000 → x = cube root of 64,000.Let me compute cube root of 64,000. Well, 64 is 4³, and 1000 is 10³, so 64,000 = 64 × 1000 = 4³ × 10³ = (4×10)³ = 40³. Wait, 40³ is 64,000? Let's check: 40×40=1600, 1600×40=64,000. Yes! So x³ = 40³ → x = 40 cm.Now, find h using h = 32,000 / x². x is 40, so x² = 1600. Then h = 32,000 / 1600 = 20 cm.Wait, let me verify. Volume: 40×40×20 = 32,000, which matches. Then surface area: base is 40²=1600, four sides each 40×20=800, so total sides 4×800=3200. Total surface area 1600 + 3200 = 4800 cm².To confirm it's a minimum, we can check the second derivative. S''(x) = 2 + 256,000/x³. Since x is positive, S''(x) is always positive, so the critical point is a minimum.So the dimensions are base 40 cm by 40 cm, height 20 cm.

2025-08-11 17:35:45,260 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - ReAct agent response: Okay, let me tackle this optimization problem. So, we have a box with a square base and open top, volume 32,000 cm³. Need to find dimensions that minimize the material, which is the surface area since it's open top.First, define variables. Let x be the side length of the base (since it's square), and h be the height. Volume is base area times height, so x²h = 32,000. That means h = 32,000 / x². Got that.Surface area for an open top box: the base is x², and there are four sides each of area x*h. So total surface area S = x² + 4xh. Now substitute h from the volume equation. So S = x² + 4x*(32,000/x²) = x² + 128,000/x. That simplifies the surface area to a function of x alone.To minimize S, take derivative S'(x) = 2x - 128,000/x². Set derivative to zero to find critical points. So 2x = 128,000/x² → multiply both sides by x²: 2x³ = 128,000 → x³ = 64,000 → x = cube root of 64,000. Let me compute that: 40³ is 64,000 because 40*40=1600, 1600*40=64,000. So x=40 cm.Then h = 32,000 / (40²) = 32,000 / 1600 = 20 cm. So height is 20 cm.Check if this is a minimum. Second derivative S''(x) = 2 + 256,000/x³. Since x is positive, S''(x) is positive, so it's a minimum. That makes sense.So dimensions are base 40x40 cm, height 20 cm. Let me double-check the surface area calculation. If x=40, h=20, then base area is 1600, four sides are 4*40*20=3200, total surface area 1600+3200=4800 cm². If I take x=30, h=32000/900≈35.555, surface area=900 + 4*30*35.555≈900+4266.6≈5166.6, which is higher. If x=50, h=32000/2500=12.8, surface area=2500 + 4*50*12.8=2500+2560=5060, which is also higher than 4800. So yes, 40x40x20 gives lower surface area. Looks good.</think>Final Answer: The box should have a square base of 40 cm by 40 cm and a height of 20 cm to minimize material usage.

2025-08-11 17:39:32,396 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - Agent thinking: Okay, let's see. I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of (e^(2x) - 1 - 2x) divided by x squared using L'Hôpital's Rule. Hmm, first, I should check if it's an indeterminate form. Let me plug in x = 0 into the numerator and denominator.Numerator: e^(0) - 1 - 0 = 1 - 1 - 0 = 0. Denominator: 0^2 = 0. So it's 0/0, which means L'Hôpital's Rule applies. Right, so I can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator separately and then take the limit again.Let's compute the derivatives. The derivative of the numerator: d/dx [e^(2x) - 1 - 2x] = 2e^(2x) - 2. The derivative of the denominator: d/dx [x^2] = 2x. So now the limit becomes (2e^(2x) - 2)/(2x) as x approaches 0. Let's check if this is still indeterminate. Plugging in x=0: numerator is 2*1 - 2 = 0, denominator is 0. So it's still 0/0. Need to apply L'Hôpital's Rule again.Take derivatives again. Derivative of numerator: d/dx [2e^(2x) - 2] = 4e^(2x). Derivative of denominator: d/dx [2x] = 2. Now the limit is 4e^(2x)/2 as x approaches 0. Simplify that: 2e^(2x). Plugging in x=0: 2e^0 = 2*1 = 2. So the limit should be 2.Wait, let me verify. Let's do it step by step again to make sure. First application: (e^(2x)-1-2x)/x² → 0/0. Take derivatives: (2e^(2x)-2)/(2x). Still 0/0. Second application: derivative of numerator is 4e^(2x), denominator derivative is 2. So 4e^(2x)/2 = 2e^(2x). At x=0, that's 2*1=2. Yep, that seems right.I think that's correct. Let me check with another method maybe. Maybe Taylor series. The Taylor series for e^(2x) around 0 is 1 + 2x + (2x)^2/2! + (2x)^3/3! + ... So e^(2x) -1 -2x = (4x²/2) + (8x³/6) + ... = 2x² + (4x³/3) + ... Then divide by x²: 2 + (4x/3) + ... So as x approaches 0, the limit is 2. Yep, matches. So the answer is 2.

2025-08-11 17:39:40,529 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - ReAct agent response: .</think>Okay, let's see. The user asked to use L'Hôpital's Rule to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of (e^(2x) - 1 - 2x)/x^2.First, I need to check if it's an indeterminate form. Plugging in x=0, the numerator is e^0 -1 -0 = 1 -1 = 0, and the denominator is 0^2 = 0. So it's 0/0, which means L'Hôpital's Rule applies.Applying L'Hôpital's Rule once: take derivatives of numerator and denominator. The derivative of the numerator e^(2x) -1 -2x is 2e^(2x) - 2. The derivative of the denominator x^2 is 2x. So now the limit is (2e^(2x) - 2)/(2x) as x approaches 0. Plugging in x=0 again, numerator is 2*1 -2 = 0, denominator is 0. Still 0/0, so need to apply L'Hôpital's Rule again.Take derivatives again. The derivative of 2e^(2x) -2 is 4e^(2x), and the derivative of 2x is 2. So the new limit is 4e^(2x)/2 as x approaches 0. Simplify that to 2e^(2x). Plugging in x=0, e^0 is 1, so 2*1 = 2. So the limit is 2.I should verify if each step is correct. First application: yes, derivatives are right. Second application: yes, 4e^(2x)/2 simplifies to 2e^(2x). At x=0, that's 2. So the answer should be 2. The user probably expects the boxed answer as per the example. Let me make sure there are no calculation errors. Yep, seems correct. So the final answer is 2.</think>Final Answer: $\boxed{2}$

Hmm, this looks like a case where I should use logarithmic differentiation because it's a function raised to another function. Let me recall how that works.First, take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify the exponent. So, ln y = ln[(cos x)^x]. Using logarithm properties, that becomes x * ln(cos x). Now, I need to differentiate both sides with respect to x. The left side will be (1/y) * y' by the chain rule. The right side is the derivative of x * ln(cos x), which requires the product rule.Let me write that out:d/dx [ln y] = d/dx [x * ln(cos x)]Left side: (1/y) * y'Right side: Use product rule. Let u = x, v = ln(cos x). Then u' = 1, v' = derivative of ln(cos x) which is (1/cos x) * (-sin x) = -tan x.So, right side derivative is u'v + uv' = 1 * ln(cos x) + x * (-tan x) = ln(cos x) - x tan x.Putting it all together:(1/y) * y' = ln(cos x) - x tan xMultiply both sides by y:y' = y [ln(cos x) - x tan x]But y is (cos x)^x, so substitute back:y' = (cos x)^x [ln(cos x) - x tan x]Wait, let me check if I did the derivative of ln(cos x) correctly. The derivative of ln(u) is u'/u. Here u = cos x, so u' = -sin x. So derivative is (-sin x)/cos x = -tan x. Yes, that's right. So v' is -tan x, so uv' is x*(-tan x). So the right side is ln(cos x) - x tan x. That seems correct.Let me verify with another approach. Maybe using the formula for d/dx [f(x)^g(x)] = f(x)^g(x) [g'(x) ln f(x) + g(x) f'(x)/f(x)]. Wait, in this case, f(x) = cos x, g(x) = x. So f'(x) = -sin x. Then the derivative should be (cos x)^x [ (1) * ln(cos x) + x * (-sin x)/cos x ] which simplifies to (cos x)^x [ ln(cos x) - x tan x ]. Yep, same as before. So that checks out.So the derivative is (cos x)^x times [ln(cos x) - x tan x].I think that's it. Let me make sure there are no mistakes. Let's take a simple case to test. Suppose x is 0. Then cos(0) = 1, so y = 1^0 = 1. The derivative at x=0 would be (1)^0 [ln(1) - 0 * tan(0)] = 1*(0 - 0) = 0. Let's see if that makes sense. The function at x=0 is 1. For small x, cos x ≈ 1 - x²/2, so (cos x)^x ≈ (1 - x²/2)^x ≈ e^{x * (-x²/2)} = e^{-x^3/2} ≈ 1 - x^3/2, so the derivative at 0 would be 0, which matches. So that seems to check out.Another check: if x = π/3, cos(π/3) = 0.5, so y = (0.5)^(π/3). The derivative would be (0.5)^(π/3) [ln(0.5) - (π/3) tan(π/3)]. tan(π/3) is √3, so it's (0.5)^(π/3) [ln(0.5) - (π/3)√3]. That seems plausible.So I think the derivative is correctly found as (cos x)^x [ln(cos x) - x tan x].

They seem to be emphasizing the correctness of the solution, possibly for verification or to highlight that their derivation is accurate.Hmm, I notice they've structured the response as a formal proof with clear steps, which suggests they might be a student or educator wanting to confirm their understanding. The repetition makes me think they might be testing if I can recognize the core content beneath the redundancy.The key points they've covered are:- Taking natural log of both sides (correct step for exponential functions with variable base/exponent)- Applying product rule correctly (x times ln(cos x))- Handling the chain rule for ln(cos x) properly (-tan x)- Solving for y' and substituting backNo errors in their derivation - this is standard logarithmic differentiation. The final answer matches what I'd calculate. The repetition might be accidental (copy-paste error) or intentional to stress the solution's validity.I should acknowledge their correct work while avoiding unnecessary repetition. Since they've clearly mastered this, I'll affirm the solution concisely and add one practical note about when this technique is necessary (to reinforce their understanding).

2025-08-11 17:43:37,452 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - Agent thinking: Okay, let's see. I need to solve this related rates problem with the ladder. So, the ladder is 13 feet long, leaning against a wall. The top is sliding down at 2 ft/s, and I need to find how fast the bottom is moving away when it's 5 feet from the wall.First, I remember that related rates problems usually involve using the Pythagorean theorem since it's a right triangle. Let me set up the variables. Let x be the distance from the bottom of the ladder to the wall, and y be the height of the top of the ladder on the wall. The ladder is the hypotenuse, so x² + y² = 13².Given that the top is sliding down, dy/dt is -2 ft/s (negative because y is decreasing). We need to find dx/dt when x = 5 ft.Wait, let's confirm the variables. If x is the bottom moving away, then dx/dt is what we need. The problem states when the bottom is 5 feet from the wall, so x = 5. Then, first, find y when x is 5. Using Pythagoras: y = sqrt(13² - 5²) = sqrt(169 - 25) = sqrt(144) = 12. So y is 12 feet at that moment.Now, differentiate the Pythagorean equation with respect to time t. So, d/dt (x² + y²) = d/dt (169). That gives 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. Simplify: x dx/dt + y dy/dt = 0. Then, solve for dx/dt: dx/dt = - (y/x) dy/dt.Plugging in the values: y = 12, x = 5, dy/dt = -2. So dx/dt = - (12/5)(-2) = (24/5) = 4.8 ft/s. So the bottom is moving away at 4.8 ft/s.Wait, let me check the signs. Since dy/dt is negative (y is decreasing), the negative sign in the equation would make dx/dt positive, which makes sense because the bottom is moving away from the wall. So 24/5 is 4.8, which is 4.8 ft/s. That seems right.I should verify if I did the differentiation correctly. Starting from x² + y² = 169. Differentiating both sides: 2x dx/dt + 2y dy/dt = 0. Yes, that's correct. So solving for dx/dt gives dx/dt = - (y/x) dy/dt. Plugging in y=12, x=5, dy/dt=-2: dx/dt = - (12/5)(-2) = 24/5 = 4.8. Yep, that checks out.I think that's the answer. Let me make sure there are no calculation errors. 13 squared is 169, 5 squared is 25, 169-25 is 144, square root of 144 is 12. Correct. Then the differentiation step is right. So the rate is 24/5 ft/s, which is 4.8 ft/s.

2025-08-11 17:49:16,243 - server.agent.agent_server - INFO - Agent thinking: Okay, let's try to figure out this limit problem. The question is to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of [sin(3x) - 3x + (27/6)x^3] divided by x^5.First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving trigonometric functions near 0, Taylor series expansions are really helpful. So I need to expand sin(3x) into its Taylor series around x=0 and then substitute that into the numerator.Let me recall the Taylor series for sin(y). The standard expansion is sin(y) = y - y^3/6 + y^5/120 - y^7/5040 + ... So for sin(3x), I should substitute y = 3x into that.Let's compute sin(3x):sin(3x) = (3x) - (3x)^3/6 + (3x)^5/120 - (3x)^7/5040 + ...Calculating each term:First term: 3xSecond term: (27x^3)/6 = (9x^3)/2 (since 27/6 simplifies to 9/2)Third term: (243x^5)/120 = (81x^5)/40 (since 243 divided by 120 is 81/40)Fourth term: (2187x^7)/5040, but since we're dividing by x^5, terms with x^7 or higher will go to 0 as x approaches 0, so maybe we can ignore them for now.Now, the numerator is sin(3x) - 3x + (27/6)x^3. Let's substitute the Taylor series into this.sin(3x) = 3x - (27x^3)/6 + (243x^5)/120 - ...So sin(3x) - 3x + (27/6)x^3 = [3x - (27x^3)/6 + (243x^5)/120 - ...] - 3x + (27/6)x^3Let's simplify term by term:3x - 3x cancels out.Then, - (27x^3)/6 + (27/6)x^3 also cancels out.So the remaining terms start with the next term in the expansion, which is (243x^5)/120 - ... So the numerator simplifies to (243/120)x^5 + higher order terms (like x^7, etc.).Dividing by x^5, the expression becomes (243/120) + higher order terms that go to 0 as x approaches 0.Simplifying 243/120: Let's see, 243 divided by 3 is 81, 120 divided by 3 is 40. So 81/40. Wait, 243 ÷ 3 = 81, 120 ÷3=40, yes. So 81/40.But wait, let me check again. The third term in the sin(3x) expansion is (3x)^5 / 120, which is 243x^5 / 120. Then the numerator is sin(3x) -3x + (27/6)x^3. Let's compute each part:sin(3x) = 3x - (3x)^3/6 + (3x)^5/120 - ... = 3x - (27x^3)/6 + (243x^5)/120 - ...So sin(3x) -3x = - (27x^3)/6 + (243x^5)/120 - ...Then adding (27/6)x^3: - (27x^3)/6 + (27/6)x^3 = 0. So the x^3 terms cancel, leaving (243x^5)/120 - ... Therefore, the numerator is (243/120)x^5 + higher order terms, so when divided by x^5, the leading term is 243/120.Simplify 243/120: divide numerator and denominator by 3: 81/40. So 81/40 is 2.025.Wait, but let me confirm that. 243 divided by 120: 120*2=240, so 243/120 = 2 + 3/120 = 2 + 1/40 = 2.025, which is 81/40 (since 81*5=405, 40*5=200, no, wait 81/40 is 2.025. Yes, 40*2=80, so 81/40=2.025).So the limit should be 81/40.Wait, but let me check if I did the Taylor series correctly. The standard Taylor series for sin(y) is y - y^3/6 + y^5/120 - y^7/5040 + ... So for y=3x, sin(3x) = 3x - (3x)^3/6 + (3x)^5/120 - ... So:(3x)^3 = 27x^3, so divided by 6 is 27x^3/6.(3x)^5 = 243x^5, divided by 120 is 243x^5/120.So the numerator is sin(3x) -3x + (27/6)x^3 = [3x - 27x^3/6 + 243x^5/120 - ...] -3x + 27x^3/6.Yes, the 3x and -3x cancel, the -27x^3/6 and +27x^3/6 cancel, leaving 243x^5/120 - ..., so dividing by x^5 gives 243/120 = 81/40.So the limit is 81/40.Wait, but the problem states (27/6)x^3. 27/6 is 9/2, which is the same as (27x^3)/6. So that's correct.Therefore, the limit is 81/40.Let me check with L'Hospital's Rule, just to confirm. But since it's a 0/0 indeterminate form, applying L'Hospital's multiple times might be tedious, but let's see.First, as x approaches 0, sin(3x) ~ 3x - (3x)^3/6 + (3x)^5/120, so sin(3x) -3x + (27/6)x^3 ~ [3x - 27x^3/6 + 243x^5/120] -3x + 27x^3/6 = 243x^5/120. So numerator ~ (243/120)x^5, denominator x^5, so the limit is 243/120 = 81/40. So that's correct.Therefore, the answer should be 81/40.

So:(3x)^3 = 27x^3, so divided by 6 is 27x^3/6.(3x)^5 = 243x^5, divided by 120 is 243x^5/120.So the numerator is sin(3x) -3x + (27/6)x^3 = [3x - 27x^3/6 + 243x^5/120 - ...] -3x + 27x^3/6.Yes, the 3x and -3x cancel, the -27x^3/6 and +27x^3/6 cancel, leaving 243x^5/120 - ..., so dividing by x^5 gives 243/120 = 81/40.So the limit is 81/40.Wait, but the problem states (27/6)x^3. 27/6 is 9/2, which is the same as (27x^3)/6.
