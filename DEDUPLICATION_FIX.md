# Tool Learning Deduplication Fix

## Problem Identified
The tool learning system was showing duplicate learning advisories like this:
```
Tool Learning Advisory:
⚠️ LEARNING: read_file fails when file path is incorrect or file doesn't exist → Use search_codebase to find files by content or name patterns before reading
⚠️ LEARNING: read_file fails when file path is incorrect or file doesn't exist → Use search_codebase to find files by content or name patterns before reading
```

## Root Cause
1. **Storage Level**: Multiple identical learnings were being stored in the database
2. **Retrieval Level**: The query system wasn't deduplicating similar patterns before returning results

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Learning Storage (`analyze_failure_success_pattern`)
- Added `_learning_already_exists()` check before storing new learnings
- Prevents creation of duplicate learnings at the source
- Returns `None` when a similar learning already exists

### 2. Improved Learning Retrieval (`query_relevant_learnings`)  
- Added deduplication logic in `_filter_relevant_learnings()`
- Uses pattern-based keys to track seen learnings: `failure_pattern|successful_alternative`
- Ensures only unique learning patterns are returned

### 3. Similarity Detection
- `_learning_already_exists()`: Checks database for similar existing learnings
- `_learnings_are_similar()`: Compares two learning objects for similarity
- `_patterns_are_similar()`: Uses Jaccard similarity with 80% threshold for pattern matching

## Key Benefits
✅ **No More Duplicates**: Advisory messages now show each unique learning only once  
✅ **Improved Performance**: Reduced database storage and faster queries  
✅ **Better User Experience**: Cleaner, more concise learning advisories  
✅ **Maintained Learning Quality**: High-confidence learnings are preserved without redundancy

## Test Results
- ✅ Deduplication test passed: 0 duplicates created from 3 identical scenarios
- ✅ Advisory test passed: Only 1 unique learning shown instead of duplicates
- ✅ Existing learnings preserved: Previous valid learnings remain accessible

## Files Modified
- `server/agent/tool_learning_store.py`: Added deduplication logic
- Created test files to verify the fix works correctly

The system now properly manages learning uniqueness at both storage and retrieval levels, eliminating the duplicate advisory issue.
