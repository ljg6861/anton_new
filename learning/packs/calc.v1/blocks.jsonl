This chapter will jump directly into the two problems that the subject was invented to solve. You will see what the questions are, and you will see an important part of the answer. There are plenty of good things left for the other chapters, so why not get started?\nThe book begins with an example that is familiar to everybody who drives a car.\nIt is calculus in action-the driver sees it happening. The example is the relation between the speedometer and the odometer. One measures the speed (or velocity);\nthe other measures the distance traveled. We will write v for the velocity, and f for how far the car has gone. The two instruments sit together on the dashboard:\nFig. 1.1 Velocity v and total distance f (at one instant of time).\nNotice that the units of measurement are different for v and f.The distance f is measured in kilometers or miles (it is easier to say miles). The velocity v is measured in km/hr or miles per hour. A unit of time enters the velocity but not the distance.\nEvery formula to compute v from f will have f divided by time.\nThe central question of calculus is the relation between v and f.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 7, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

If we know the velocity over the whole history of the car, we should be able to compute the total distance traveled.\nIn other words, if the speedometer record is complete but the odometer is missing, its information could be recovered. One way to do it (without calculus) is to put in a new odometer and drive the car all over again at the right speeds. That seems like a hard way; calculus may be easier. But the point is that the information is there.\nIf we know everything about v, there must be a method to find f .\nWhat happens in the opposite direction, when f is known? If you have a complete record of distance, could you recover the complete velocity? In principle you could drive the car, repeat the history, and read off the speed. Again there must be a better way.\nThe whole subject of calculus is built on the relation between u and f . The question we are raising here is not some kind of joke, after which the book will get serious and the mathematics will get started. On the contrary, I am serious now-and the mathematics has already started. We need to know how to find the velocity from a record of the distance. (That is called &@erentiation, and it is the central idea of dflerential calculus.) We also want to compute the distance from a history of the velocity. (That is integration, and it is the goal of integral calculus.) Differentiation goes from f to v; integration goes from v to f . We look first at examples in which these pairs can be computed and understood.\nCONSTANT VELOCITY Suppose the velocity is fixed at v = 60 (miles per hour). Then f increases at this constant rate. After two hours the distance is f = 120 (miles). After four hours f = 240 and after t hours f = 60t. We say that f increases linearly with time-its graph is a straight line.\n4 velocity v ( t ) 4 distancef(t) v 2 4 0\n~\n~ s 1\n~\n=\n\"\n= 6 0 4 Area 240 :\nI time t time t Fig. 1.2 Constant velocity v =60 and linearly increasing distance f=60t.\nNotice that this example starts the car at full velocity. No time is spent picking up speed. (The velocity is a \"step function.\") Notice also that the distance starts at zero;\nthe car is new. Those decisions make the graphs of v and f as neat as possible. One is the horizontal line v = 60. The other is the sloping line f = 60t. This v, f , t relation needs algebra but not calculus:\nif v is constant and f starts at zero then f = vt.\nThe opposite is also true. When f increases linearly, v is constant. The division by time gives the slope. The distance is fl = 120 miles when the time is t1 = 2 hours.\nLater f' =240 at t, = 4. At both points, the ratio f/t is 60 miles/hour. Geometrically, the velocity is the slope of the distance graph:\nchange in distance - vt slope =\n- v.\nchange in time t", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 8, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Figure 1.3 shows two more possibilities:\n1. The distance starts at 20 instead of 0. The distance formula changes from 60t to 20 + 60t. The number 20 cancels when we compute change in distance-so the slope is still 60.\n2. When v is negative, the graph off goes downward. The car goes backward and the slope off = -30t is v = -30.\nI don't think speedometers go below zero. But driving backwards, it's not that safe to watch. If you go fast enough, Toyota says they measure \"absolute valuesw-the speedometer reads + 30 when the velocity is -30. For the odometer, as far as I know it just stops. It should go backward.?\nVELOCITY vs. DISTANCE: SLOPE vs. AREA How do you compute f' from v? The point of the question is to see f = ut on the graphs. We want to start with the graph of v and discover the graph off. Amazingly, the opposite of slope is area.\nThe distance f is the area under the v-graph. When v is constant, the region under the graph is a rectangle. Its height is v, its width is t, and its area is v times t. This is integration, to go from v to f by computing the area. We are glimpsing two of the central facts of calculus.\n1A The slope of the f-graph gives the velocity v. The area under the v-graph gives the distance f.\nThat is certainly not obvious, and I hesitated a long time before I wrote it down in this first section. The best way to understand it is to look first at more examples. The whole point of calculus is to deal with velocities that are not constant, and from now on v has several values.\nEXAMPLE (Forward and back) There is a motion that you will understand right away.\nThe car goes forward with velocity V, and comes back at the same speed. To say it more correctly, the velocity in the second part is - V. If the forward part lasts until t = 3, and the backward part continues to t = 6, the car will come back where it started.\nThe total distance after both parts will be f = 0.\n+This actually happened in Ferris Bueller's Day 08,when the hero borrowed his father's sports car and ran up the mileage. At home he raised the car and drove in reverse. I forget if it worked.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 9, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The distance starts up with slope + V and reaches f = 3V. Then the car starts backward. The distance goes down with slope\n- V and returns to f = 0 at t = 6.\nNotice what that means. The total area \"under\" the v-graph is zero! A negative velocity makes the distance graph go downward (negative slope). The car is moving backward. Area below the axis in the v-graph is counted as negative.\nFUNCTIONS This forward-back example gives practice with a crucially important idea-the concept of a \"jiunction.\" We seize this golden opportunity to explain functions:\nThe number v(t) is the value of the function t. at the time t.\nThe time t is the input to the function. The velocity v(t) at that time is the output.\nMost people say \"v oft\" when they read v(t). The number \"v of 2\" is the velocity when t = 2. The forward-back example has v(2) = + V and v(4) = - V. The function contains the whole history, like a memory bank that has a record of v at each t.\nIt is simple to convert forward-back motion into a formula. Here is v(t):\nThe ,right side contains the instructions for finding v(t). The input t is converted into the output + V or - V. The velocity v(t) depends on t. In this case the function is\n\"di~continuo~s,~' because the needle jumps at t = 3. The velocity is not dejined at that instant. There is no v(3). (You might argue that v is zero at the jump, but that leads to trouble.) The graph off' has a corner, and we can't give its slope.\nThe problem also involves a second function, namely the distance. The principle behind f(t) is the same: f (t) is the distance at time t. It is the net distance forward, and again the instructions change at t = 3. In the forward motion, f(t) equals Vt as before. In the backward half, a calculation is built into the formula for f(t):\nAt the switching time the right side gives two instructions (one on each line).

After t = 3 the distance decreases because of - Vt. At t = 6 the second instruction correctly gives f (6) = 0.\nNotice something more. The functions were given by graphs before they were given by formulas. The graphs tell you f and v at every time t-sometimes more clearly than the formulas. The values f (t) and v(t) can also be given by tables or equations or a set of instructions. (In some way all functions are instructions-the function tells how to find f at time t.) Part of knowing f is knowing all its inputs and outputs-its domain and range:\nThe domain of a function is the set of inputs. The range is the set of outputs.\nThe domain of f consists of all times 0 < t < 6. The range consists of all distances 0 <f(t) < 3V. (The range of v contains only the two velocities + V and - V.) We mention now, and repeat later, that every \"linear\" function has a formula f (t) = vt + C. Its graph is a line and v is the slope. The constant C moves the line up and down. It adjusts the line to go through any desired starting point.\nSUMMARY: MORE ABOUT FUNCTIONS May I collect together the ideas brought out by this example? We had two functions v and f. One was velocity, the other was distance. Each function had a domain, and a range, and most important a graph. For the f-graph we studied the slope\n(which agreed with v). For the v-graph we studied the area (which agreed with f).\nCalculus produces functions in pairs, and the best thing a book can do early is to show you more of them.\ninput t + function f\n-, output f (t)\n\" { input 2 + function u\n+ output v(2) 1 the domain input 7 + f (t) = 2t + 6 + f (7)= 20 range in Note about the definition of a function. The idea behind the symbol f (t) is absolutely crucial to mathematics. Words don't do it justice! By definition, a function is a \"rule\" that assigns one member of the range to each member of the domain. Or, a function is a set of pairs (t, f (t)) with no t appearing twice. (These are \"ordered pairs\" because we write t before f (t).) Both of those definitions are correct-but somehow they are too passive.\nIn practice what matters is the active part. The number f (t) is produced from the number t. We read a graph, plug into a formula, solve an equation, run a computer program. The input t is \"mapped\" to the output f(t), which changes as t changes.\nCalculus is about the rate of change. This rate is our other function v.\nFig. 1.5 Subtracting 2 from f affects the range.

Those are both new functions, created out of the original f (t).\nIn f (t)- 2, we subtract 2 from all the distances. That moves the whole graph down.\nIn f(t - 2), we subtract 2 from the time. That moves the graph over to the right.\nFigure 1.5 shows both movements, starting from f (t) = 2t + 1. The formula to find f(t - 2) is 2(t - 2) + 1, which is 2t - 3.\nA graphing calculator also moves the graph, when you change the viewing window.\nYou can pick any rectangle A < t < B, C <f(t) < D. The screen shows that part of the graph. But on the calculator, the function f ( t )remains the same. It is the axes that get renumbered. In our figures the axes stay the same and the function is changed.\nThere are two more basic ways to change a function. (We are always creating new functions-that is what mathematics is all about.) Instead of subtracting or adding, we can multiply the distance by 2. Figure 1.6 shows 2f (t). And instead of shifting the time, we can speed it up. The function becomes f(2t). Everything happens twice as fast (and takes half as long). On the calculator those changes correspond to a\n\"zoom\"-on the f axis or the t axis. We soon come back to zooms.\n0 I t 0 I t 0 domain 1 1 112 Fig. 1.6 Doubling the distance or speeding up the time doubles the slope.\n1.1 EXERCISES Each section of the book contains read-through questions. They allow you to outline the section yourself-more actively than reading a summary. This is probably the best way to remember the important ideas.\nStarting from f(0) = 0 at constant velocity v, the distance function is f (t)= a . When f (t) = 55t the velocity is v = b . When f(t) = 55t + 1000 the velocity is still c and the starting value is f (0)= d\n. In each case v is the e of the graph off. When f is negative, the graph of s goes downward. In that case area in the t.-graph counts as h .\nForward motion from f (0)= 0 to f (2)= 10 has v = i\n.\nThen backward motion to f (4)= 0 has v = i\n. The distance function is f (t)= 5t for 0 < t < 2 and then f (t)= k\n(not -5t). The slopes are I and m . The distance f(3) = n\n. The area under the v-graph up to time 1.5 is o\n. The domain off is the time interval P , and the range is the distance interval q . The range of v(t) is only\n- 1\n.\nThe value off (t) = 3t + 1 at t = 2 is f (2) = s . The value 19 equals f ( t\n). The difference f (4)-f (1) = u\n. That is the change in distance, when 4 - 1 is the change in v .\nThe ratio of those changes equals w , which is the x of the graph. The formula for f (t) + 2 is 3t + 3 whereas f (t + 2) equals Y\n. Those functions have the same z as f: the graph of f (t)+ 2 is shifted A and f (t + 2) is shifted B\n. The formula for f (5t) is C .

The numbers in f can go up or down, the differences in v can be positive or negative. The idea behind calculus comes when you add up those differences:\n2+4+1-3+5=9 The sum of differences is 9. This is the last number on the top line (in f). Is this an accident, or is this always true? If we stop earlier, after 2 + 4 + 1, we get the 7 in f.\nTest any prediction on a second example:\nSuppose the numbers are f= 1 3 7 8 5 10 Their differences are v = 2 4 1 -3 5 The f's are increased by 1. The differences are exactly the same-no change. The sum of differences is still 9. But the last f is now 10. That prediction is not right, we don't always get the last f.\nThe first f is now 1. The answer 9 (the sum of differences) is 10 - 1, the last f minus the first f. What happens when we change the f's in the middle?\nSuppose the numbers are f= 1 5 12 7 10 Their differences are v = 4 7\n-5 3 The differences add to 4 + 7 - 5 + 3 = 9. This is still 10 - 1. No matter what f's we choose or how many, the sum of differences is controlled by the first f and last f.\nIf this is always true, there must be a clear reason why the middle f's cancel out.\nThe sum of differences is (5 - 1) + (12 - 5) + (7 - 12) + (10 - 7) = 10 - 1.\nThe 5's cancel, the 12's cancel, and the 7's cancel. It is only 10 - 1 that doesn't cancel.\nThis is the key to calculus!\nEXAMPLE 1 The numbers grow linearly: f= 2 3 4 5 6 7 Their differences are constant: v = 1 1 1 1 1 The sum of differences is certainly 5. This agrees with 7 - 2 =fast -ffirst. The numbers in v remind us of constant velocity. The numbers in f remind us of a straight line f= vt + C. This example has v = 1 and the f's start at 2. The straight line would come from f= t + 2.\nEXAMPLE 2 The numbers are squares: f= 0 1 4 9 16 Their differences grow linearly: v = 1 3 5 7 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 agrees with 42 = 16. It is a beautiful fact that the first j odd numbers always add up to j2. The v's are the odd numbers, the f's are perfect squares.\nNote The letter j is sometimes useful to tell which number in f we are looking at.\nFor this example the zeroth number is fo = 0 and the jth number is fj =j2. This is a part of algebra, to give a formula for the f's instead of a list of numbers. We can also use j to tell which difference we are looking at. The first v is the first odd number v,\n= 1. The jth difference is the jth odd number vj = 2j- 1.\n(Thus v4 is 8 - I = 7.) It is better to start the differences with j = 1, since there is no zeroth odd number vo.\nWith this notation the jth difference is vj =fj -f -1.\nSooner or later you will get comfortable with subscripts like j and j - 1, but it can be later. The important point is that the sum of the v's equals flast -first. We now connect the v's to slopes and the f's to areas.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 15, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Squares in the distances f= 0, 1, 4, 9, 16.\nFigure 1.7 shows a natural way to graph Example 2, with the odd numbers in v and the squares in f. Notice an important difference between the v-graph and the f-graph.\nThe graph of f is \"piecewise linear.\" We plotted the numbers in f and connected them by straight lines. The graph of v is \"piecewise constant.\" We plotted the differences as constant over each piece. This reminds us of the distance-velocity graphs, when the distance f(t) is a straight line and the velocity v(t) is a horizontal line.\nNow make the connection to slopes:\ndistance up change in f The slope of the f-graph is distance change in distance across change in t Over each piece, the change in t (across) is 1. The change in f (upward) is the difference that we are calling v. The ratio is the slope v/1l or just v. The slope makes a sudden change at the breakpoints t = 1, 2, 3, .... At those special points the slope of the f-graph is not defined-we connected the v's by vertical lines but this is very debatable. The main idea is that between the breakpoints, the slope of f(t) is v(t).\nNow make the connection to areas:\nThe total area under the v-graph is flast -ffirst This area, underneath the staircase in Figure 1.7, is composed of rectangles. The base of every rectangle is 1. The heights of the rectangles are the v's. So the areas also equal the v's, and the total area is the sum of the v's. This area is flast -first.\nEven more is true. We could start at any time and end at any later time\n-not necessarily at the special times t = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Suppose we stop at t = 3.5.\nOnly half of the last rectangular area (under v = 7) will be counted. The total area is 1 + 3 + 5 + 2(7) = 12.5. This still agrees with flast -first = 12.5 - 0. At this new ending time t = 3.5, we are only halfway up the last step in the f-graph. Halfway between 9 and 16 is 12.5.\nThis is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. But we have only used algebra (no curved graphs and no calculations involving limits). For now the Theorem is restricted to piecewise linear f(t) and piecewise constant v(t). In Chapter 5 that restriction will be overcome.\nNotice that a proof of 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 42 is suggested by Figure 1.7a. The triangle under the dotted line has the same area as the four rectangles under the staircase.\nThe area of the triangle is ½. base . height =\n-4 8, which is the perfect 9quare 42 When there are j rectangles instead of 4, we get .j. 2j =j2 for the area.\n0~~~~~~~ 1 nrdcin oCluu", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 16, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

I hope you like them but I don't think you have to learn them.\nThey are like the special functions 2' and sin t and cos t-except they go in steps.\nYou get a first look at the important functions of calculus, but you only need algebra.\nCalculus is needed for a steadily changing velocity, when the graph off is curved.\nThe last example will be income tax-which really does go. in steps. Then Section 1.3 will introduce the slope of a curve. The crucial step for curves is working with limits. That will take us from algebra to calculus.\nEXPONENTIAL VELOCITY AND DISTANCE Start with the numbers f = 1,2,4,8, 16. These are \"powers of 2.\" They start with the zeroth power, which is 2' = 1. The exponential starts at 1 and not 0. After j steps there are j factors of 2, and & equals 2j. Please recognize the diflerence between 2j and j2 and 2j. The numbers 2j grow linearly, the numbers j2grow quadratically, the numbers 2' grow exponentially. At j = 10 these are 20 and 100 and 1024. The exponential 2' quickly becomes much larger than the others.\nThe differences off = 1,2,4,8, 16 are exactly v = 1,2,4,8.. We get the same beautiful numbers. When the f's are powers of 2, so are the v's. The formula vj = 2\"-' is slightly different from & = 2j, because the first v is numbered v,. (Then v, = 2' = 1.\nThe zeroth power of every number is 1, except that 0' is meaningless.) The two graphs in Figure 1.8 use the same numbers but they look different, because f is piecewise linear and v is piecewise constant.\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 Fig. 1.8 The velocity and distance grow exponentially (powers of 2).\nWhere will calculus come in? It works with the smooth curve f (t)= 2'. This exponential growth is critically important for population and money in a bank and the national debt. You can spot it by the following test: v(t) is proportional to f (t).\nRemark The function 2' is trickier than t2. For f = t2 the slope is v = 2t. It is proportional to t and not t2. For f = 2' the slope is v = c2', and we won't find the constant c = .693 ... until Chapter 6. (The number c is the natural logarithm of 2.) Problem 37 estimates c with a calculator-the important thing is that it's constant.\nOSCILLATING VELOCITY AND DISTANCE We have seen a forward-back motion, velocity V followed by -V. That is oscillation of the simplest kind. The graph off goes linearly up and linearly down. Figure 1.9 shows another oscillation that returns to zero, but the path is more interesting.\nThe numbers in f are now 0, 1, 1,0, -1, -l,O. Since f6 = 0 the motion brings us back to the start.

They add up to zero, which agrees with Jast -Airst. It is the same oscillation as in f (and also repeatable), but shifted in time.\nThe f-graph resembles (roughly) a sine curve. The v-graph resembles (even more roughly) a cosine curve. The waveforms in nature are smooth curves, while these are\n\"digitized\"-the way a digital watch goes forward in jumps. You recognize that the change from analog to digital brought the computer revolution. The same revolution is coming in CD players. Digital signals (off or on, 0 or 1 ) seem to win every time.\nThe piecewise v and f start again at t = 6. The ordinary sine and cosine repeat at t =2n. A repeating motion is periodic-here the \"period\" is 6 or 2n. (With t in degrees the period is 360-a full circle. The period becomes 2n when angles are measured in radians. We virtually always use radians-which are degrees times 2n/360.) A watch has a period of 12 hours.

The speed is V until the distance reaches f = 1, when the car suddenly stops. The graph of f goes up linearly with slope V, and then across with slope zero:\nV upto t = T Vt up to t = T v(t) = f (0= 0 after t = T 1 after t = T This is another example of \"function notation.\" Notice the general time t and the particular stopping time T. The distance is f (t). The domain off (the inputs) includes all times t 3 0. The range of f (the outputs) includes all distances 0 ff < 1.\nFigure 1.10 allows us to compare three cars-a Jeep and a Corvette and a Maserati.\nThey have different speeds but they all reach f = 1.

It is zero except at the jump. At that moment, which is t = 0, the slope is infinite. We don't have an ordinary velocity v(t)-instead we have an impulse that makes the car jump. The graph is a spike over the single point t = 0, and it is often denoted by 6-so the slope of the step function is called a \"delta function.\" The area under the infinite spike is 1.\nYou are absolutely not responsible for the theory of delta functions! Calculus is about curves, not jumps.\nOur last example is a real-world application of slopes ands rates-to explain \"how taxes work.\" Note especially the difference between tax rates and tax brackets and total tax. The rates are v, the brackets are on x, the total tax is f.\nEXAMPLE 3 Income tax is piecewise linear. The slopes are the tax rates .15,.28,.31.\nSuppose you are single with taxable income of x dollars (Form 1040, line 37-after all deductions). These are the 1991 instructions from the Internal Revenue Service:\nIf x is not over $20,350, the tax is 15% of x.\nIf $20,350 < x < $49,300, the tax is $3052.50 + 28% of the amount over $20,350.\nIf x is over $49,300, the tax is $11,158.50 + 31% of the amount over $49,300.\nThe first bracket is 0 < x < $20,350. (The IRS never uses this symbol <, but I think it is OK here. We know what it means.) The second bracket is $20,350 < x < $49,300.\nThe top bracket x > $49,300 pays tax at the top rate of 31%. But only the income in that bracket is taxed at that rate.\nFigure 1.11 shows the rates and the brackets and the tax due. Those are not average rates, they are marginal rates. Total tax divided by total income would be the average rate. The marginal rate of.28 or .31 gives the tax on each additional dollar of incomeit is the slope at the point x. Tax is like area or distance-it adds up. Tax rate is like slope or velocity-it depends where you are.

There are two questions, in opposite directions, and I hope you could see them coming.\n1. If the velocity is changing, how can you compute the distance traveled?\n2. If the graph of f(t) is not a straight line, what is its slope?\nFind the distance from the velocity, find the velocity from the distance. Our goal is to do both-but not in one section. Calculus may be a good course, but it is not magic. The first step is to let the velocity change in the steadiest possible way.\nQuestion 1 Suppose the velocity at each time t is v(t) = 2t. Find f (t).\nWith zr= 2t, a physicist would say that the acceleration is constant (it equals 2). The driver steps on the gas, the car accelerates, and the speedometer goes steadily up.\nThe distance goes up too-faster and faster. If we measure t in seconds and v in feet per second, the distance f comes out in feet. After 10 seconds the speed is 20 feet per second. After 44 seconds the speed is 88 feetlsecond (which is 60 miles/hour).\nThe acceleration is clear, but how far has the car gone?", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 22, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The distance f= t2 is quadratic.\nI hope you see the problem. As the car goes faster, the graph of t2 gets steeperbecause more distance is covered in each second. The average velocity between t = 10 and t = 11 is a good approximation-but only an approximation-to the speed at the moment t = 10. Averages are easy to find:\naverage velocity is f (1 1) -f (10) - 121 - 100 = 21.\n11- 10 1 The car covered 21 feet in that 1 second. Its average speed was 21 feetlsecond. Since it was gaining speed, the velocity at the beginning of that second was below 21.\nGeometrically, what is the average? It is a slope, but not the slope of the curve.\nThe average velocity is the slope of a straight line. The line goes between two points on the curve in Figure 1.12. When we compute an average, we pretend the velocity is constant-so we go back to the easiest case. It only requires a division of distance by time:\nchange in f average velocity = change in t ' Calculus and the Law You enter a highway at 1 :00. If you exit 150 miles away at 3 :00, your average speed is 75 miles per hour. I'm not sure if the police can give you a ticket.

The average velocity over the next second is 21. We can also find the average over the half-second between t = 10.0 and t = 10.5. Divide the change in distance by the change in time:\nf (10.5) -f (10.0) - (10.5)2-(10.0)2- 110.25 - 100 = 20.5.\n10.5 - 10.0\n.5\n.5 That average of 20.5 is closer to the speed at t = 10. It is still not exact.\nThe way to find v(10) is to keep reducing the time interval. This is the basis for Chapter 2, and the key to differential calculus. Find the slope between points that are closer and closer on the curve. The \"limit\" is the slope at a single point.\nAlgebra gives the average velocity between t = 10 and any later time t = 10 + h.\nThe distance increases from lo2 to (10 + h)l. The change in time is h. So divide:\nThis formula fits our previous calculations. The interval from t = 10 to t = 11 had h = 1, and the average was 20 + h = 21. When the time step was h =i,the average was 20 + 4= 20.5. Over a millionth of a second the average will be 20 plus 1/1,000,000-which is very near 20.\nConclusion: The velocity at t = 10 is v = 20. That is the slope of the curve. It agrees with the v-graph on the left side of Figure 1.12, which also has v(10) = 20.\nWe now show that the two graphs match at all times. If f (t) = t2 then v(t) = 2t.\nYou are seeing the key computation of calculus, and we can put it into words before equations. Compute the distance at time t + h, subtract the distance at time t, and divide by h. That gives the average velocity:\nThis fits the previous calculation, where t was 10. The average was 20 + h. Now the average is 2t + h. It depends on the time step h, because the velocity is changing. But we can see what happens as h approaches zero. The average is closer and closer to the speedometer reading of 2t, at the exact moment when the clock shows time t:\nI 1E As h approaches zero, the average velooity 2t + h approaches v(t) = 2t. I Note The computation (3) shows how calculus needs algebra. If we want the whole v-graph, we have to let time be a \"variable.\" It is represented by the letter t. Numbers are enough at the specific time t = 10 and the specific step h = 1-but algebra gets beyond that. The average between any t and any t + h is 2t + h. Please don't hesitate to put back numbers for the letters-that checks the algebra.\n+This is our first encounter with the much despised \"Mean Value Theorem.\" If the judge can prove the theorem, you are dead.

Calculus requires the limit of the average. As h shrinks to zero, the points on the graph come closer. \"Average over an interval\" becomes \"velocity at an instant.'' The general theory of limits is not particularly simple, but here we don't need it. (It isn't particularly hard either.) In this example the limiting value is easy to identify. The average 2t + h approaches 2t, as h -, 0.\nWhat remains to do in this section? We answered Question 2-to find velocity from distance. We have not answered Question 1. If v(t) = 2t increases linearly with time, what is the distance? This goes in the opposite direction (it is integration).\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that no new work is necessary. Zfthe slope off (t) leads to v(t), then the area under that v-graph leads back to the f-graph.\nThe odometer readings f = t2 produced speedometer readings v = 2t. By the Fundamental Theorem, the area under 2t should be t2. But we have certainly not proved any fundamental theorems, so it is better to be safe-by actually computing the area.\nFortunately, it is the area of a triangle. The base of the triangle is t and the height is v = 2t. The area agrees with f (t):\narea = i(base)(height)= f(t)(2t)= t2.\n(4) EXAMPLE 1 The graphs are shifted in time. The car doesn't start until t = 1. Therefore v = 0 and f = O up to that time. After the car starts we have v = 2(t - 1) and f = (t - You see how the time delay of 1 enters the formulas.

That is one of the most famous pairs in calculus.\nIf a equals the gravitational constant g, then v = gt is the velocity of a falling body.\nThe speed doesn't depend on the mass (tested by Galileo at the Leaning Tower of Pisa).

The velocity contains an additional 3 (coming from 3h divided by h). When 3t is added to the distance, 3 is added to the velocity. If Galileo had thrown a weight instead of dropping it, the starting velocity vo would have added vot to the distance.\nFUNCTIONS ACROSS TIME The idea of slope is not difficult-for one straight line. Divide the change in f by the change in t. In Chapter 2, divide the change in y by the change in x. Experience shows that the hard part is to see what happens to the slope as the line moves.\nFigure 1.l4a shows the line between points A and B on the curve.

So does the change in t.\nQuestion 2 As B approaches A, does the slope of the line increase or decrease?\nAnswer I am not going to answer that question. It is too important. Draw another secant line with B closer to A. Compare the slopes.\nThis question was created by Steve Monk at the University of Washington-where 57% of the class gave the right answer.

Finding the speed (or slope) is entirely different from finding the distance (or area):\n1. To find the slope of the f-graph at a'particular time t, you don't have to know the whole history.\n2. To find the area under the v-graph up to a particular time t, you do have to know the whole history.\nA short record of distance is enough to recover v(t).

As I write that last word, I ask myself how much trigonometry it is essential to know. There will be the basic picture of a right triangle, with sides cos t and sin t and 1. There will also be the crucial equation (cos t)2+ (sin t)2= 1, which is Pythagoras' law a' + b2 = c2. The squares of two sides add to the square of the hypotenuse (and the 1 is really 12). Nothing else is needed immediately. If you don't know trigonometry, don't stop-an important part can be learned now.\nYou will recognize the wavy graphs of the sine and cosine. W e intend to Jind the slopes of those graphs. That can be done without using the formulas for sin(x + y) and cos (x + y)-which later give the same slopes in a more algebraic way. Here it is only basic things that are needed.? And anyway, how complicated can a triangle be?\nRemark You might think trigonometry is only for surveyors and navigators (people with triangles). Not at all! By far the biggest applications are to rotation and vibration and oscillation.

Calculus is mainly an extension of common sense, but here that extension is not needed. We will find the slope of the sine curve. The straight line f = vt was easy and the parabola f = +at2 was harder. The new example also involves realistic motion, seen every day. We start with circular motion, in which the position is given and the velocity will be found.\nA ball goes around a circle of radius one. The center is at x = 0, y = 0 (the origin).\nThe x and y coordinates satisfy x 2 + y2 = 12,to keep the ball on the circle. We specify its position in Figure 1.16a by giving its angle with the horizontal. And we make the ball travel with constant speed, by requiring that the angle is equal to the time t. The ball goes counterclockwise. At time 1 it reaches the point where the angle equals 1.\nThe angle is measured in radians rather than degrees, so a full circle is completed at t = 271 instead of t = 360.\nThe ball starts on the x axis, where the angle is zero. Now find it at time t:\nThe ball is at the point where x = cos t and y = sin t.\nThis is where trigonometry is useful. The cosine oscillates between 1 and -1, as the ball goes from far right to far left and back again. The sine also oscillates between 1 and - 1, starting from sin 0 = 0. At time 7112 the sine (the height) increases to one.\nThe cosine is zero and the ball reaches the top point x = 0, y = 1. At time 71 the cosine is -1 and the sine is back to zero-the coordinates are (- 1,O).

The ball travels a distance 2n in a time 2n. The speed equals 1. It remains to find the velocity, which involves not only speed but direction.\nDegrees vs. radians A full circle is 360 degrees and 271 radians. Therefore 1 radian = 36012~ degrees = 57.3 degrees 1 degree = 2711360 radians = .01745 radians Radians were invented to avoid those numbers! The speed is exactly 1, reaching t radians at time t. The speed would be .01745, if the ball only reached t degrees. The ball would complete the circle at time T = 360. We cannot accept the division of the circle into 360 pieces (by whom?), which produces these numbers.\nTo check degree mode vs. radian mode, verify that sin lo z .017 and sin 1 = 34.\nVELOCITY OF THE BALL At time t, which direction is the ball going? Calculus watches the motion between t and t + h. For a ball on a string, we don't need calculus-just let go. The direction of motion is tangent to the circle. With no force to keep it on the circle, the ball goes oflon a tangent. If the ball is the moon, the force is gravity. If it is a hammer swinging around on a chain, the force is from the center. When the thrower lets go, the hammer takes off-and it is an art to pick the right moment. (I once saw a friend hit by a hammer at MIT. He survived, but the thrower quit track.) Calculus will find that same tangent direction, when the points at t and t + h come close.\nThe \"velocity triangle\" is in Figure 1.16b. It is the same as the position triangle, but rotated through 90\". The hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, in the direction the ball is moving. Its length equals 1 (the speed). The angle t still appears, but now it is the angle with the vertical. The upward component of velocity is cos t, when the upward component of position is sin t. That is our common sense calculation, based on a figure rather than a formula. The rest of this section depends on it-and we check v = cos t at special points.\nAt the starting time t = 0, the movement is all upward. The height is sin 0 = 0 and the upward velocity is cos 0 = 1. At time ~ 1 2 , the ball reaches the top. The height is sin 4 2 = 1 and the upward velocity is cos n/2 = 0. At that instant the ball is not moving up or down.\nThe horizontal velocity contains a minus sign. At first the ball travels to the left.\nThe value of x is cos t, but the speed in the x direction is -sin t. Half of trigonometry is in that figure (the good half), and you see how sin2 t + cos2 t = 1 is so basic.\nThat equation applies to position and velocity, at every time.\nApplication of plane geometry: The right triangles in Figure 1.16 are the same size and shape. They look congruent and they are-the angle t above the ball equals the angle t at the center. That is because the three angles at the ball add to 180\".\nOSCILLATION: UP AND DOWN MOTION We now use circular motion to study straight-line motion. That line will be the y axis.\nInstead of a ball going around a circle, a mass will move up and down. It oscillates between y = 1 and y = - 1.

The distance graph is a zigzag (or sawtooth) from Section 1.2.\nWe prefer a smoother motion. Instead of velocities that jump between +1 and -1, a real oscillation slows down to zero and gradually builds up speed again. The mass is on a spring, which pulls it back. The velocity drops to zero as the spring is fully stretched. Then v is negative, as the mass goes the same distance in the opposite direction. Simple harmonic motion is the most important back and forth motion, while f = vt and f = fat2 are the most important one-way motions.\n) turn\n(.p=mst;///J U P fup = sin t down turn Fig. 1.17 Circular motion of the ball and harmonic motion of the mass (its shadow).\nHow do we describe this oscillation? The best way is to match it with the ball on the circle. The height of the ball will be the height of the mass. The \"shadow of the ball\" goes up and down, level with the ball. As the ball passes the top of the circle, the mass stops at the top and starts down. As the ball goes around the bottom, the mass stops and turns back up the y axis. Halfway up (or down), the speed is 1.\nFigure 1.17a shows the mass at a typical time t. The height is y =f (t)= sin t, level with the ball. This height oscillates between f = 1 and f = -1. But the mass does not move with constant speed. The speed of the mass is changing although the speed of the ball is always 1. The time for a full cycle is still 2n, but within that cycle the mass speeds up and slows down. The problem is to find the changing velocity u. Since the distance is f = sin t, the velocity will be the slope of the sine curve.\nTHE SLOPE OF THE SINE CURVE At the top and bottom (t = n/2 and t = 3~12) the ball changes direction and v = 0.\nThe slope at the top and bottom of the sine curve is zero.? At time zero, when the ball is going straight up, the slope of the sine curve is v = 1. At t = n,when the ball and mass and f-graph are going down, the velocity is v = -1. The mass goes fastest at the center. The mass goes slowest (in fact it stops) when the height reaches a maximum or minimum. The velocity triangle yields v at every time t.\nTo find the upward velocity of the mass, look at the upward velocity of the ball.\nThose velocities are the same! The mass and ball stay level, and we know v from circular motion: The upward velocity is v = cos t.\n?That looks easy but you will see later that it is extremely important.

This is absolutely fantastic, that in calculus the two most famous functions of trigonometry form a pair:\nThe slope of the sine curve is given by the cosine curve.\nWhen the distance is f (t) = sin t, the velocity is v(t)= cos t.\nAdmission of guilt: The slope of sin t was not computed in the standard way.\nPreviously we compared (t + h)' with t2,and divided that distance by h. This average velocity approached the slope 2t as h became small. For sin t we could have done the same:\nchange in sin t sin (t + h) - sin t average velocity = change in t - h\n(1) This is where we need the formula for sin (t + h), coming soon.

The time for a full circle is only n. The ball's position is x = cos 2t and y = sin 2t. The velocity is still tangent to the circle-but the tangent is at angle 2t where the ball is. Therefore cos 2t enters the upward velocity and\n-sin 2t enters the horizontal velocity. The difference is that the velocity triangle is twice as big. The upward velocity is not cos 2t but 2 cos 2t. The horizontal velocity is -2 sin 2t. Notice these 2's!\nQuestion 2 What is the area under the cosine curve from t = 0 to t = n/2?\nYou can answer that, if you accept the Fundamental Theorem of Calculuscomputing areas is the opposite of computing slopes. The slope of sin t is cos t, so the area under cos t is the increase in sin t. No reason to believe that yet, but we use it anyway.\nFrom sin 0 = 0 to sin n/2 = 1, the increase is 1.

The f-graph and v-graph are still correct, both with a time shift of 4 2 .\nThe new f-graph is the cosine. The new v-graph is minus the sine. The slope of the cosine curve follows the negative of the sine curve.

The book is more personal than usual, and I hope readers will approve. What I write is very close to what I would say, if you were in this room. The sentences are spoken before they are written.?

We focus on one particular angle-call it 8-and on the ratios between the three sides x, y, r. The ratios don't change if the triangle is scaled to another size. Three sides give six ratios, which are the basic functions of trigonometry:\nn r 1 cos 8 = -x = near side set 8 = - = - r hypo tenuse x cos 8 sin 8 = -y = opposite side csc 8 = -r = - 1 r hypotenuse y sin 8 R X I y y opposite side x 1 tan 8 = - = cot g = - = - Fig. 1.19 x near side y tan 8 Of course those six ratios are not independent. The three on the right come directly from the three on the left. And the tangent is the sine divided by the cosine:\nNote that \"tangent of an angle\" and \"tangent to a circle\" and \"tangent line to a graph\" are different uses of the same word. As the cosine of 8 goes to zero, the tangent of 8 goes to infinity. The side x becomes zero, 8 approaches 90\", and the triangle is infinitely steep. The sine of 90\" is y/r = 1.\nTriangles have a serious limitation. They are excellent for angles up to 90°, and they are OK up to 180\", but after that they fail. We cannot put a 240\" angle into a triangle. Therefore we change now to a circle.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 35, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Compare 2 sin 8 with sin 28 and tan 8 (periods 2n, n, n).\nAngles are measured from the positive x axis (counterclockwise). Thus 90\" is straight up, 180\" is to the left, and 360\" is in the same direction as 0\". (Then 450\" is the same as 90°.) Each angle yields a point on the circle of radius r. The coordinates x and y of that point can be negative (but never r). As the point goes around the circle, the six ratios cos 8, sin 9, tan 8, .. . trace out six graphs. The cosine waveform is the same as the sine waveform-just shifted by 90\".\nOne more change comes with the move to a circle. Degrees are out. Radians are in. The distance around the whole circle is 2nr. The distance around to other points is Or. We measure the angle by that multiple 8. For a half-circle the distance is m, so the angle is n radians-which is 180\". A quarter-circle is 4 2 radians or 90\".\nThe distance around to angle 8 is r times 8.\nWhen r = 1 this is the ultimate in simplicity: The distance is 8.

The angle -n/3 is -60\" and takes us 4of the wrong way around the circle. What is the effect on the six functions?\nCertainly the radius r is not changed when we go to -8. Also x is not changed\n(see Figure 1.20a). But y reverses sign, because -8 is below the axis when +8 is above. This change in y affects y/r and y/x but not xlr:\nThe cosine is even (no change). The sine and tangent are odd (change sign).\nThe same point is 2 of the right way around. Therefore 2 of 2n radians (or 300\") gives the same direction as -n/3 radians or -60\". A diflerence of 2n makes no di$erence to x, y, r. Thus sin 8 and cos 8 and the other four functions have period 27~.\nWe can go five times or a hundred times around the circle, adding 10n or 200n to the angle, and the six functions repeat themselves.\nEXAMPLE Evaluate the six trigonometric functions at 8 = 2n/3 (or 8 = -443).\nThis angle is shown in Figure 1.20a (where r = 1).

This is a much-used formula for cos 2t:\nDouble angle: cos 2t = cos2 t - sin2 t = 2 cos2 t - 1 = 1 - 2 sin2 t.\n(6) I am constantly using cos2 t + sin2 t = 1, to switch between sines and cosines.\nWe also need addition formulas and double-angle formulas for the sine of s - t and s + t and 2t. For that we connect sine to cosine, rather than (sine)2 to (co~ine)~.\nThe connection goes back to the ratio y/r in our original triangle. This is the sine of the angle 0 and also the cosine of the complementary angle 7112 - 0:\nsin 0 = cos (7112 - 0) and cos 0 = sin (7112 - 0).\n(7) The complementary angle is 7112 - 0 because the two angles add to 7112 (a right angle).\nBy making this connection in Problem 19, formulas (4-5-6) move from cosines to sines:\nsin (s - t) =sin s cos t - cos s sin t\n(8) sin(s + t) = sin s cos t + cos s sin t\n(9) sin 2t = sin(t + t) = 2 sin t cos t\n(10) I want to stop with these ten formulas, even if more are possible. Trigonometry is full of identities that connect its six functions-basically because all those functions come from a single right triangle. The x, y, r ratios and the equation x2 + y2 = r2 can be rewritten in many ways. But you have now seen the formulas that are needed by ca1culus.t They give derivatives in Chapter 2 and integrals in Chapter 5. And it is typical of our subject to add something of its own-a limit in which an angle approaches zero. The essence of calculus is in that limit.\nReview of the ten formulas Figure 1.22 shows d2 = (0 -$)2+ (1 - -12)~.\n71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 71 cos - = cos - cos - + sin - 71 sin -\n(s - t) sin - = sin - cos --cos - sin - 6 2 3 2 3 6 2 3 2 3 571 71 71 71 71 571 71 71 71 cos -= cos - cos - - sin - sin -\n(s + t) sin -= sin - cos - + cos - 71 sin - 6 2 3 2 3 6 2 3 2 3 71 71 71\n(2t) sin 2 - = 2 sin - cos - 3 3 3 71 71 sin - = cos - 71 = 112 cos 2 = sin - = -12\n(4-0) 6 3 6 3 tcalculus turns (6) around to cos2 t =i(1 + cos 2t) and sin2 t =i(1 -cos 2t).", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 38, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The graph of sin x is one continuous curve. By the time it reaches x = 10,000, the curve has gone up and down 10,000/27r times. Those 1591 oscillations would be so crowded that you couldn't see anything. The graph of sin n has picked 10,000 points from the curve-and for some reason those points seem to lie on more than 40 separate sine curves.\nThe second graph shows the first 1000 points. They don't seem to lie on sine curves.\nMost people see hexagons. But they are the same thousand points! It is hard to believe that the graphs are the same, but I have learned what to do. Tilt the second graph and look from the side at a narrow angle. Now the first graph appears. You see\n\"diamonds.\" The narrow angle compresses the x axis-back to the scale of the first graph.\n1\n-", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 40, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Which points are near (0, O)?\n2. How many sine curves are there?\n3. Where does the middle curve, going upward from (0, 0), come back to zero?\nA point near (0,O) really means that sin n is close to zero. That is certainly not true of sin 1 (1 is one radian!). In fact sin 1 is up the axis at .84, at the start of the seventh sine curve. Similarly sin 2 is .91 and sin 3 is .14. (The numbers 3 and .14 make us think of n. The sine of 3 equals the sine of n - 3. Then sin .l4 is near .14.) Similarly sin 4, sin 5, . . . , sin 21 are not especially close to zero.\nThe first point to come close is sin 22. This is because 2217 is near n. Then 22 is close to 771, whose sine is zero:\nsin 22 = sin (7n - 22) z sin (- .01) z - .01.\nThat is the first point to the right of (0,O) and slightly below. You can see it on graph 1, and more clearly on graph 2. It begins a curve downward.\nThe next point to come close is sin 44. This is because 44 is just past 14n.\n44 z 14n + .02 so sin 44 z sin .02 z .02.\nThis point (44, sin 44) starts the middle sine curve. Next is (88, sin 88).\nNow we know something. There are 44 curves. They begin near the heights sin 0, sin 1, . . . , sin 43. Of these 44 curves, 22 start upward and 22 start downward. I was confused at first, because I could only find 42 curves. The reason is that sin 11 equals\n- 0.99999 and sin 33 equals .9999. Those are so close to the bottom and top that you can't see their curves. The sine of 11 is near - 1 because sin 22 is near zero. It is almost impossible to follow a single curve past the top-coming back down it is not the curve you think it is.\nThe points on the middle curve are at n = 0 and 44 and 88 and every number 44N.\nWhere does that curve come back to zero? In other words, when does 44N come very close to a multiple of n? We know that 44 is 14n + .02. More exactly 44 is 14n + .0177. So we multiply .0177 until we reach n:\nif N=n/.0177 then 44N=(14n+.0177)N3 14nN+n.\nThis gives N = 177.5. At that point 44N = 7810. This is half the period of the sine curve. The sine of 7810 is very near zero.\nIf you follow the middle sine curve, you will see it come back to zero above 7810.\nThe actual points on that curve have n = 44 177 and n = 44 178, with sines just above and below zero. Halfway between is n = 7810. The equation for the middle sine curve is y = sin (nx/78lO). Its period is 15,620-beyond our graph.\nQuestion The fourth point on that middle curve looks the same as the fourth point coming down from sin 3. What is this \"double point?\" Answer 4 times 44 is 176. On the curve going up, the point is (176, sin 176). On the curve coming down it is (1 79, sin 179). The sines of 176 and 179 difler only by .00003.\nThe second graph spreads out this double point. Look above 176 and 179, at the center of a hexagon. You can follow the sine curve all the way across graph 2.\nOnly a little question remains. Why does graph 2 have hexagons? I don't know.\nThe problem is with your eyes. To understand the hexagons, Doug Hardin plotted points on straight lines as well as sine curves. Graph 3 shows y = fractional part of n/2x. Then he made a second copy, turned it over, and placed it on top. That produced graph 4-with hexagons.

If you can get a transparent copy of graph 3, and turn it slowly over the original, you will see fantastic hexagons. They come from interference between periodic patterns-in our case 4417 and 2514 and 1913 are near 271. This interference is an enemy of printers, when color screens don't line up. It can cause vertical lines on a TV. Also in making cloth, operators get dizzy from seeing Moire patterns move. There are good applications in engineering and optics-but we have to get back to calculus.\n1.7 Computing in Calculus Software is available for calculus courses-a lot of it. The packages keep getting better. Which program to use (if any) depends on cost and convenience and purpose.\nHow to use it is a much harder question. These pages identify some of the goals, and also particular packages and calculators. Then we make a beginning (this is still Chapter 1) on the connection of computing to calculus.\nThe discussion will be informal. It makes no sense to copy the manual. Our aim is to support, with examples and information, the effort to use computing to help learning.\nFor calculus, the gveatest advantage of the computev is to o$er graphics. You see the function, not just the formula. As you watch, f ( x ) reaches a maximum or a minimum or zero. A separate graph shows its derivative. Those statements are not 100% true, as everybody learns right away-as soon as a few functions are typed in.\nBut the power to see this subject is enormous, because it is adjustable. If we don't like the picture we change to a new viewing window.\nThis is computer-based graphics. It combines numerical computation with gvaphical computation. You get pictures as well as numbers-a powerful combination.\nThe computer offers the experience of actually working with a function. The domain and range are not just abstract ideas. You choose them. May I give a few examples.\nEXAMPLE I Certainly x3 equals 3\" when x = 3. Do those graphs ever meet again'?\nAt this point we don't know the full meaning of 3\", except when x is a nice number.\n(Neither does the computer.) Checking at x = 2 and 4, the function x3 is smaller both times: 23 is below 3* and 43 = 64 is below 34 = 81. If x3 is always less than 3\" we ought to know-these are among the basic functions of mathematics.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 42, "section_id": "s0003-untitled"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

At our command, it solves x3 = 3X. At another command, it plots both functions-this shows more. The screen proves a point of logic (or mathematics) that escaped us. If the graphs cross once, they must cross again-because 3\" is higher at 2 and 4. A crossing point near 2.5 is seen by zooming in. I am less interested in the exact number than its position-it comes before x = 3 rather than after.\nA few conclusions from such a basic example:\n1. A supercomputer is not necessary.\n2. High-level programming is not necessary.\n3. We can do mathematics without completely understanding it.\nThe third point doesn't sound so good. Write it differently: We can learn mathematics while doing it. The hardest part of teaching calculus is to turn it from a spectator sport into a workout. The computer makes that possible.\nEXAMPLE 2 (mental computer) Compare x2 with 2X. The functions meet at x = 2.\nWhere do they meet again? Is it before or after 2?\nThat is mental computing because the answer happens to be a whole number (4).\nNow we are on a different track. Does an accident like Z4 = 42 ever happen again?\nCan the machine tell us about integers? Perhaps it can plot the solutions of xb = bx.\nI asked Mathernatica for a formula, hoping to discover x as a function of b-but the program just gave back the equation. For once the machine typed HELP icstead of the user.\nWell, mathematics is not helpless. I am proud of calculus. There is a new exercise at the end of Section 6.4, to show that we never see whole numbers again.\nEXAMPLE 3 Find the number b for which xb = bx has only one solution(at x = b).\nWhen b is 3, the second solution is below 3. When b is 2, the second solution (4) is above 2. If we move b from 2 to 3, there must be a special \"double point\"-where the graphs barely touch but don't cross. For that particular b-and only for that one value-the curve xb never goes above bx.\nThis special point b can be found with computer-based graphics. In many ways it is the \"center point of calculus.\" Since the curves touch but don't cross, they are tangent. They have the same slope at the double point. Calculus was created to work with slopes, and we already know the slope of x2. Soon comes xb. Eventually we discover the slope of bx, and identify the most important number in calculus.\nThe point is that this number can be discovered first by experiment.\nEXAMPLE 4 Graph y(x) = ex- xe. Locate its minimum.\nThe next example was proposed by Don Small. Solve x4 - 1 lx3 + 5x - 2 = 0.The first tool is algebra-try to factor the polynomial. That succeeds for quadratics, and then gets extremely hard. Even if the computer can do algebra better than we can, factoring is seldom the way to go. In reality we have two good choices:\n1. (Mathematics)Use the derivative. Solve by Newton's method.\n2. (Graphics)Plot the function and zoom in.\nBoth will be done by the computer. Both have potential problems! Newton's method is fast, but that means it can fail fast. (It is usually terrific.) Plotting the graph is also fast-but solutions can be outside the viewing window.

The graph seems to be leaving zero, but mathematics again predicts a second crossing point. So we zoom out before we zoom in.\nThe use of the zoom is the best part of graphing. Not only do we choose the domain and range, we change them. The viewing window is controlled by four numbers. They can be the limits A <x <B and C d y d D. They can be the coordinates of two opposite corners: (A, C) and (B, D). They can be the center position (a, b) and the scale factors c and d. Clicking on opposite corners of the zoom box is the fastest way, unless the center is unchanged and we only need to give scale factors. (Even faster:\nUse the default factors.) Section 3.4 discusses the centering transform and zoom transform-a change of picture on the screen and a change of variable within the function.\nEXAMPLE 5 Find all real solutions to x4 - 1 lx3 + 5x - 2 =0.\nEXAMPLE 6 Zoom out and in on the graphs of y = cos 40x and y = x sin (llx).\nDescribe what you see.\nU(AMpLE 7 What does y = (tan x - sin x)/x3 become at x = O? For small x the machine eventually can't separate tan x from sin x. It may give y = 0. Can you get close enough to see the limit of y?\nFor these examples, and for most computer exercises in this book, a menu-driven system is entirely adequate. There is a list of commands to choose from. The user provides a formula for y(x), and many functions are built in. A calculus supplement can be very useful-MicroCalc or True BASIC or Exploring Calculus or MPP (in the public domain). Specific to graphics are Surface Plotter and Master Grapher and Gyrographics (animated). The best software for linear algebra is MATLAB.\nPowerful packages are increasing in convenience and decreasing in cost. They are capable of symbolic computation-which opens up a third avenue of computing in calculus.\nSYMBOLIC COMPUTATION In symbolic computation, answers can be formulas as well as numbers and graphs.\nThe derivative of y = x2 is seen as \"2x.\" The derivative of sin t is \"cos t.\" The slope of bx is known to the program. The computer does more than substitute numbers into formulas-it operates directly on the formulas. We need to think where this fits with learning calculus.\nIn a way, symbolic computing is close to what we ourselves do. Maybe too closethere is some danger that symbolic manipulation is all we do. With a higher-level language and enough power, a computer can print the derivative of sin(x2). So why learn the chain rule? Because mathematics goes deeper than \"algebra with formulas.\" We deal with ideas.\nI want to say clearly: Mathematics is not formulas, or computations, or even proofs, but ideas. The symbols and pictures are the language. The book and the professor and the computer can join in teaching it. The computer should be non-threatening\n(like this book and your professor)-you can work at your own pace. Your part is to learn by doing.\nEXAMPLE 8 A computer algebra system quickly finds 100 factorial. This is loo! =\n(100)(99)(98)... (1). The number has 158 digits (not written out here).

How many zeros (exactly) are at the end of N!?\nFor Question 1,the computer shows more than N digits when N = 100. It will never show more than N2 digits, because none of the N terms can have more than N digits.\nA much tighter bound would be 2N, but is it true? Does N! always have fewer than 2N digits?\nFor Question 2, the zeros in lo! can be explained. One comes from 10, the other from 5 times 2. (10 is also 5 times 2.) Can you explain the 24 zeros in loo!? An idea from the card game blackjack applies here too: Count the$ves.\nHard question: How many zeros at the end of 200!?\nThe outstanding package for full-scale symbolic computation is Mathematica. It was used to draw graphs for this book, including y = sin n on the back cover. The complete command was List Plot [Table [Sin [n], (n, 10000)]]. This system has rewards and also drawbacks, including the price. Its original purpose, like MathCAD and MACSYMA and REDUCE, was not to teach calculus-but it can. The computer algebra system MAPLE is good.\nAs I write in 1990, DERIVE is becoming well established for the PC. For the Macintosh, Calculus TIL is a \"sleeper\" that deserves to be widely known. It builds on MAPLE and is much more accessible for calculus. An important alternative is Theorist. These are menu-driven (therefore easier at the start) and not expensive.\nI strongly recommend that students share terminals and work together. Two at a terminal and 3-5 in a working group seems to be optimal. Mathematics can be learned by talking and writing-it is a human activity. Our goal is not to test but to teach and learn.\nWriting in Calculus May I emphasize the importance of writing? We totally miss it, when the answer is just a number. A one-page report is harder on instructors as well as students-but much more valuable. A word processor keeps it neat. You can't write sentences without being forced to organize ideas-and part of yourself goes into it.\nI will propose a writing exercise with options. If you have computer-based graphing, follow through on Examples 1-4 above and report. Without a computer, pick a paragraph from this book that should be clearer and make it clearer. Rewrite it with examples. Identify the key idea at the start, explain it, and come back to express it differently at the end. Ideas are like surfaces-they can be seen many ways.\nEvery reader will understand that in software there is no last word. New packages keep coming (Analyzer and EPIC among them). The biggest challenges at this moment are three-dimensional graphics and calculus workbooks. In 30, the problem is the position of the eye-since the screen is only 20. In workbooks, the problem is to get past symbol manipulation and reach ideas. Every teacher, including this one, knows how hard that is and hopes to help.\nGRAPHING CALCULATORS The most valuable feature for calculus-computer-based graphing-is available on hand calculators. With trace and zoom their graphs are quite readable. By creating the graphs you subconsciously learn about functions.

We don't count the zeros in 100 factorial (probably we could). A calculator finds crossing points and maximum points to good accuracy. Most of all it allows you to explore calculus by yourself. You set the viewing window and define the function. Then you see it.\nThere is a choice of calculators-which one to buy? For this book there was also a choice-which one to describe? To provide you with listings for useful programs, we had to choose. Fortunately the logic is so clear that you can translate the instructions into any language-for a computer as well as a calculator. The programs given here are the \"greatest common denominator\" of computing in calculus.\nThe range of choices starts with the Casio fx 7000G-the first and simplest, with very limited memory but a good screen. The Casio 7500,8000, and 8500 have increasing memory and extra features. The Sharp EL-5200 (or 9000 in Canada and Europe) is comparable to the Casio 8000.

More expensive and much more powerful are the Hewlett-Packard calculators-the HP-28s and HP-48SX.\nThey have large memories and extensive menus (and symbolic algebra). They use reverse Polish notation-numbers first in the stack, then commands. They require extra time and effort, and other books do justice to their amazing capabilities. It is estimated that those calculators could get 95 on a typical calculus exam.\nWhile this book was being written, Texas Instruments produced a new graphing calculator: the TI-81. It is closer to the Casio and Sharp (emphasis on graphing, easy to learn, no symbolic algebra, moderate price). With earlier machines as a starting point, many improvements were added. There is some risk in a choice that is available only At before this textbook is published, and we hope that the experts we asked are right. Anyway, our programs are Jbr the TI-81. It is impressive.\nThese few pages are no substitute for the manual that comes with a calculator. A valuable supplement is a guide directed especially at calculus-my absolute favorites are Calculus Activities for Graphic Calculators by Dennis Pence (PWS-Kent, 1990 for the Casio and Sharp and HP-28S, 1991 for the TI-81). A series of Calculator Enhancements, using HP's, is being published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. What follows is an introduction to one part of a calculus laboratory. Later in the book, we supply TI-81 programs close to the mathematics and the exercises that they are prepared for.\nA few words to start: To select from a menu, press the item number and E N T E R.\nEdit a command line using D E L(ete) and I N S(ert). Every line ends with E N T E R. For calculus select radians on the M 0 D E screen. For powers use * . For special powers choose x2, x-l, &.Multiplication has priority, so (-)3 + 2 x 2 produces 1. Use keys for S I N , I F , I S, .. . When you press letters, I multiplies S .\nIf a program says 3 + C , type 3 S T 0 C E N T E R. Storage locations are A to Z or Greek 8.\nFunctions A graphing calculator helps you (forces you?) to understand the concept of a function. It also helps you to understand specific functions-especially when changing the viewing window.\nTo evaluate y = x2 - 2x just once, use the home screen. To define y(x) for repeated use, move to the function edit screen: Press M0 D E, choose F un c t io n, and press Y =. Then type in the formula. Important tip: for X on the TI-81, the key X I T is faster than two steps A L p h a X.

You want to focus on one part. A computer or calculator will trace along the graph, stop at a point, and zoom in.\nThere is also Z 0 0 M 0U T, to widen the ranges and see more. Our eyes work the same way-they put together information on different scales. Looking around the room uses an amazingly large part of the human brain. With a big enough computer we can try to imitate the eyes-this is a key problem in artificial intelligence. With a small computer and a zoom feature, we can use our eyes to understand functions.\nPress T R A C E to locate a point on the graph. A blinking cursor appears. Move left or right-the cursor stays on the graph. Its coordinates appear at the bottom of the screen. When x changes by a pixel, the calculator evaluates y(x). To solve y(x) =0, read off x at the point when y is nearest to zero. To minimize or maximize y(x), read off the smallest and largest y. In all these problems, zoom in for more accuracy.\nTo blow up a figure we can choose new ranges. The fast way is to use a Z 0 0 M command. Forapresetrange,use Z O O M S t a n d a r d or Z O O M T r ig.Toshrink or stretch by X F a c t or Y F a c t (default values 4), use Z 0 0 M In or Z 0 0 M 0 u t .\nChoose the center point and press E N T E R.

Press E N T E R and this point is a small square. The same keys move a second (blinking) square to the opposite corner-the box grows as you move. Press E N T E R, and the box is the new viewing window. The graphs show the same function with a change of scale.

Two examples were in Chapter 1. When the distance is t2, the velocity is 2t. When f(t) = sin t we found v(t)= cos t. The velocity is now called the derivative o f f (t). As we move to a more formal definition and new examples, we use new symbols f' and dfldt for the derivative.\n2A At time t, the derivativef'(t)or df /dt or v(t) is f'(t)= lim fCt -t At) -f(0\n(1) At+O At The ratio on the right is the average velocity over a short time At. The derivative, on the left side, is its limit as the step At (delta t) approaches zero.\nGo slowly and look at each piece. The distance at time t + At is f (t + At). The distance at time t is f(t). Subtraction gives the change in distance, between those times. We often write A f for this difference: A f =f (t + At) -f (t). The average velocity is the ratio AflAt-change in distance divided by change in time.\nThe limit of the average velocity is the derivative, if this limit exists:\ndf - lim -.Af dt A t - 0 At This is the neat notation that Leibniz invented: Af/At approaches df /dt. Behind the innocent word \"limit\" is a process that this course will help you understand.\nNote that Af is not A times f ! It is the change in f. Similarly At is not A times t.\nIt is the time step, positive or negative and eventually small. To have a one-letter symbol we replace At by h.\nThe right sides of (1) and (2)contain average speeds. On the graph of f(t), the distance up is divided by the distance across. That gives the average slope Af /At.\nThe left sides of ( 1 ) and (2)are instantaneous speeds dfldt. They give the slope at the instant t. This is the derivative dfldt (when At and Af shrink to zero).

If we set At =0 too soon, we learn nothing. The ratio Af/At becomes 010 (which is meaningless). The numbers Af and At must approach zero together, not separately. Here their ratio is 2t +At, the average speed.\nTo repeat: Success came by writing out (t + At)2 and subtracting t2 and dividing by At. Then and only then can we approach At =0. The limit is the derivative 2t.\nThere are several new things in formulas (1) and (2). Some are easy but important, others are more profound. The idea of a function we will come back to, and the definition of a limit. But the notations can be discussed right away. They are used constantly and you also need to know how to read them aloud:\nf (t) =\"f of t\" =the value of the function f at time t At =\"delta t\" =the time step forward or backward from t f (t + At) = \"f of t plus delta t\" =the value off at time t + At Af = \"delta f\" =the change f (t + At) -f (t) Af/At = \"delta f over delta t\" =the average velocity ff(t)=\"f prime of t\" = the value of the derivative at time t df /dt = \"d f d t\" =the same as f' (the instantaneous velocity) lim = \"limit as delta t goes to zero\" = the process that starts with At+O numbers Af /At and produces the number df /dt.\nFrom those last words you see what lies behind the notation dfldt. The symbol At indicates a nonzero (usually short) length of time. The symbol dt indicates an infinitesimal (even shorter) length of time. Some mathematicians work separately with df and dt, and df/dt is their ratio. For us dfldt is a single notation (don't cancel d and don't cancel A). The derivative dfldt is the limit of AflAt. When that notation dfldt is awkward, use f' or v.\nRemark The notation hides one thing we should mention. The time step can be negative just as easily as positive. We can compute the average Af/At over a time interval before the time t, instead of after. This ratio also approaches dfldt.\nThe notation also hides another thing: The derivative might not exist. The averages AflAt might not approach a limit (it has to be the same limit going forward and backward from time t). In that case ft(t) is not defined. At that instant there is no clear reading on the speedometer. This will happen in Example 2.\nEXAMPLE 1 (Constant velocity V = 2) The distance f is V times t. The distance at time t + At is V times t + At. The diference Af is V times At:\nAf - VAt df\n- V so the limit is -= V.\nAt At dt The derivative of Vt is V. The derivative of 2t is 2.

But after the stopping time, the distance is fixed at f (t) = 6. The graph is flat beyond time 3.

The velocity falls suddenly from 2 to zero. The ratio Af/At depends, at that special moment, on whether At is positive or negative. The average velocity after time t = 3 is zero. The average velocity before that time is 2. When the graph off has a corner, the graph of v has a jump. It is a step function.\nOne new part of that example is the notation (dfldt or f' instead of v). Please look also at the third figure. It shows how the function takes t (on the left) to f (t). Especially it shows At and Af. At the start, Af/At is 2. After the stop at t = 3, all t's go to the same f (t) = 6.

A high price t means a low demand llt. Increasing the price reduces the demand. The calculus question is: How quickly does l / t change when t changes? The \"marginal demand\" is the slope of the demand curve.\nThe big thing is to find the derivative of l / t once and for all.

We can't set At = 0 in line 2, until we have divided by At.\nThe average is Af/At = -l/t(t+ At). Now set At = 0.

The graph is going downward in Figure 2.2, and its slope is negative:\nAn increasing f (t) has positive slope. A decreasing f (t) has negative slope.\nThe slope -l/t2 is very negative for small t. A price increase severely cuts demand.\nThe next figure makes a small but important point. There is nothing sacred about t.\nOther letters can be used-especially x. A quantity can depend on position instead of time. The height changes as we go west. The area of a square changes as the side changes. Those are not affected by the passage of time, and there is no reason to use t. You will often see y =f (x), with x across and y up-connected by a function f.\nSimilarly, f is not the only possibility. Not every function is named f! That letter is useful because it stands for the word function-but we are perfectly entitled to write y(x) or y(t) instead off (x) or f (t). The distance up is a function of the distance across.

Answer Nothing.\nQuestion If we add 1 to the slope, what happens to the height? Answer The symbols t and x represent independent variables-they take any value they want to (in the domain).

With n = - 1, the slope of x-' is - 1xp2.\nThose are two pieces in a beautiful pattern, which it will be a pleasure to discover.\nWe begin with x3 and its derivative 3x2, before jumping to xn.\nEXAMPLE 1 If f (x) = x3 then Af = (x + h)3 - x3 = (x3 + 3x2 h + 3xh2 + h3) - x3.\nStep 1: Cancel x3.\nStep 2: Divide by h.\nStep 3: h goes to zero.\nAf df\n-\n= 3x2 + 3xh + h2 approaches -\n= 3x2.\nh dx That is straightforward, and you see the crucial step. The power (x + h)3 yields four separate terms x3 + 3x2h + 3xh2 + h3. (Notice 1, 3, 3, 1.) After x3 is subtracted, we can divide by h. At the limit (h = 0) we have 3x2.\nFor f(x) = xn the plan is the same. A step of size h leads to f(x + h) = (x + h)\".\nOne reason for algebra is to calculate powers like (x + h)\", and if you have forgotten the binomial formula we can recapture its main point. Start with n = 4:\nMultiplying the four x's gives x4. Multiplying the four h's gives h4. These are the easy terms, but not the crucial ones. The subtraction (x + h)4 - x4 will remove x4, and the limiting step h -, 0 will wipe out h4 (even after division by h). The products that matter are those with exactly one h. In Example 1 with (x + h)3, this key term was 3x2 h.\nDivision by h left 3x2.\nWith only one h, there are n places it can come from. Equation (1) has four h's in parentheses, and four ways to produce x3 h. Therefore the key term is 4x3 h. (Division by h leaves 4x3.) In general there are n parentheses and n ways to produce xn- ' h, so the binomial formula contains nxn - ' h:\nSubtract xn from (2). Divide by h. The key term is nxn-'. The rest disappears as h + 0:\nAf - (X + h)\" - xn nxn-' h + ..- + hn\n--\n-\n- df h h SO -=nxn-l.\nAx dx The terms replaced by the dots involve h2 and h3 and higher powers. After dividing by h, they still have at least one factor h. All those terms vanish as h approaches zero.\nEXAMPLE 2 (x + h)4 = x4 + 4x3 h + 6x2 h2 + 4xh3 + h4. This is n = 4 in detail.\nSubtract x4, divide by h, let h + 0. The derivative is 4x3. The coefficients 1,4, 6, 4, 1 are in Pascal's triangle below. For (x + h)5 the next row is 1, 5, 10, 2.\nRemark The missing terms in the binomial formula (replaced by the dots) contain all the products xn-jhj. An x or an h comes from each parenthesis. The binomial coefficient \"n choose j\" is the number of ways to choose j h's out of n parentheses. It involves n factorial, which is n(n - 1) ... (1).

When f (x) is multiplied by c, so is f (x + h). The difference Af is also multiplied by c. All averages Af /h contain c, so their limit is cf '. The only incomplete step is the last one (the limit). We still have to say what \"limit\" means.\nRule 2D is similar. Adding f + g means adding Af + Ag. Now divide by h. In the limit as h +0 we reach f' + g'-because a limit of sums is a sum of limits. Any example is easy and so is the proof-it is the definition of limit that needs care\n(Section 2.6).\nYou can now find the derivative of every polynomial. A \"polynomial\" is a combination of 1, x, x2, . . . ,xn-for example 9 + 2x - x5. That particular polynomial has slope 2 - 5x4. Note that the derivative of 9 is zero! A constant just raises or lowers the graph, without changing its slope. It alters the mileage before starting the car.\nThe disappearance of constants is one of the nice things in differential calculus.\nThe reappearance of those constants is one of the headaches in integral calculus.\nWhen you find v from f, the starting mileage doesn't matter. The constant in f has no effect on v. (Af is measured by a trip meter; At comes from a stopwatch.) To find distance from velocity, you need to know the mileage at the start.\nA LOOK AT DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS (FIND y FROM dyldx) We know that y = x3 has the derivative dyldx = 3x2. Starting with the function, we found its slope. Now reverse that process. Start with the slope andfind the function.\nThis is what science does all the time-and it seems only reasonable to say so.\nBegin with dyldx = 3x2. The slope is given, the function y is not given.\nQuestion Can you go backward to reach y = x3?\nAnswer Almost but not quite. You are only entitled to say that y = x3 + C. The constant C is the starting value of y (when x = 0). Then the dzrerential equation dyldx = 3x2 is solved.\nEvery time you find a derivative, you can go backward to solve a differential equation. The function y = x2 + x has the slope dyldx = 2x + 1. In reverse, the slope 2x + 1 produces x2 + x-and all the other functions x2 + x + C, shifted up and down.\nAfter going from distance f to velocity v, we return to f + C. But there is a lot more to differential equations. Here are two crucial points:\n1. We reach dyldx by way of AylAx, but we have no system to go backward. With dyldx = (sin x)/x we are lost. What function has this derivative?\n2. Many equations have the same solution y = x3. Economics has dyldx = 3ylx.\nGeometry has dyldx = 3y213. These equations involve y as well as dyldx. Function and slope are mixed together! This is typical of differential equations.\nTo summarize: Chapters 2-4 compute and use derivatives. Chapter 5 goes in reverse.\nIntegral calculus discovers the function from its slope. Given dyldx we find y(x). Then Chapter 6 solves the differential equation dyldt = y, function mixed with slope.\nCalculus moves from derivatives to integrals to diferential equations.\nThis discussion of the purpose of calculus should mention a sp~cific example.\nDifferential equations are applied to an epidemic (like AIDS). In most epi emics the 4:\nnumber of cases grows exponentially. The peak is quickly reached by e , and the epidemic dies down. Amazingly, exponential growth is not happening witb AIDSthe best fit to the data through 1988 is a cubic polynomial (Los Alamos Sciehce, 1989):\nThe number of cases fits a cubic within 2%: y = 174.6(t - 1981.2)3+ 340.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 60, "section_id": "s0004-2pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The average cost of making automobiles may be $10,000. But it is the\n$8000 cost of the next car that decides whether Ford makes it. \"The average describes the past, the marginal predicts the future.\" For bank deposits or work hours or wheat, which come in smaller units, the amounts are continuous variables. Then the word\n\"marginal\" says one thing: Take the derivative.?\nThe average pay over all the hours we ever worked may be low. We wouldn't work another hour for that! This average is rising, but the pay for each additional hour rises faster-possibly it jumps. When $10/hour increases to $15/hour after a 40-hour week, a 50-hour week pays $550. The average income is $ll/hour. The marginal income is $15/hour-the overtime rate.\nConcentrate next on cost. Let y(x) be the cost of producing x tons of steel. The cost of x + Ax tons is y(x + Ax). The extra cost is the difference Ay. Divide by Ax, the number of extra tons. The ratio Ay/Ax is the average cost per extra ton. When Ax is an ounce instead of a ton, we are near the marginal cost dyldx.\nExample: When the cost is x2, the average cost is x2/x = x. The marginal cost is 2x. Figure 2.4 has increasing slope-an example of \"diminishing returns to scale.\" I I fixed supply any price\n- - I E\n= O any supply E=..\nfixed price I x quantity equilibrium price price Fig. 2.4 Marginal exceeds average. Constant elasticity E = +I. Perfectly elastic to perfectly inelastic (rcurve).\nThis raises another point about economics. The units are arbitrary. In yen per kilogram the numbers look different. The way to correct for arbitrary units is to work with percentage change or relative change. An increase of Ax tons is a relative increase of Axlx. A cost increase Ay is a relative increase of Ayly. Those are dimensionless, the same in tons/tons or dollars/dollars or yen/yen.\nA third example is the demand y at price x. Now dyldx is negative. But again the units are arbitrary. The demand is in liters or gallons, the price is in dollars or pesos.\n?These paragraphs show how calculus applies to economics. You do not have to be an economist to understand them. Certainly the author is not, probably the instructor is not, possibly the student is not. We can all use dyldx.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 61, "section_id": "s0004-2pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

When the price goes up by lo%, the demand may drop by 5%. If that ratio stays the same for small increases, the elasticity of demand is f.\nActually this number should be -f.The price rose, the demand dropped. In our definition, the elasticity will be -4.In conversation between economists the minus sign is left out (I hope not forgotten).\nDEFINITION The elasticity of the demand function y(x) is AY/Y - dyldx E(x) = lim - - -.\nAX-o Axlx Y / X Elasticity is \"marginal\" divided by \"average.\" E(x)is also relative change in y divided by relative change in x. Sometimes E(x)is the same at all prices-this important case is discussed below.\nEXAMPLE 1 Suppose the demand is y = c/x when the price is x. The derivative dy/dx = -c/x2comes from calculus. The division y/x = c/x2is only algebra. The ratio is E = - 1 :\nFor the demand y = c/x, the elasticity is (- c/x2)/(c/x2)= -1 .\nAll demand curves are compared with this one. The demand is inelastic when 1 El < 1 .\nIt is elastic when IEl > 1. The demand 20/& is inelastic (E = -f), while x - ~is elastic (E = -3). The power y = cxn, whose derivative we know, is the function with constant elasticity n:\nif y = cxn then dyldx = cnxn-' and E = cnxn- l/(cxn/x) = n.\nIt is because y = cxnsets the standard that we could come so early to economics.\nIn the special case when y = clx, consumers spend the same at all prices. Price x times quantity y remains constant at xy = c.\nEXAMPLE 2 The supply curve has E > 0-supply increases with price. Now the baseline case is y = cx. The slope is c and the average is y/x = c. The elasticity is E = c / c = 1.\nCompare E = 1 with E = 0 and E = CQ. A constant supply is \"perfectly inelastic.\" The power n is zero and the slope is zero: y = c. No more is available when the harvest is over. Whatever the price, the farmer cannot suddenly grow more wheat.\nLack of elasticity makes farm economics difficult.\nThe other extreme E = a~is \"perfectly elastic.\" The supply is unlimited at a fixed price x. Once this seemed true of water and timber. In reality the steep curve x = constant is leveling off to a flat curve y = constant. Fixed price is changing to fixed supply, E = CQ is becoming E = 0, and the supply of water follows a \"gamma curve\" shaped like T.\nEXAMPLE 3 Demand is an increasing function of income-more income, more demand. The income elasticity is E(I)= (dy/dI)/(y/I).A luxury has E > 1 (elastic).\nDoubling your income more than doubles the demand for caviar. A necessity has E < 1 (inelastic). The demand for bread does not double. Please recognize how the central ideas of calculus provide a language for the central ideas of economics.\nImportant note on supply = demand This is the basic equation of microeconomics.\nWhere the supply curve meets the demand curve, the economy finds the equilibrium price. Supply = demand assumes perfect competition. With many suppliers, no one can raise the price.

The velocity was constant (at least piecewise). The distance function was linear. Now we are facing polynomials like x3 - 2 or x4 - x2 + 3, with other functions to come soon. Their graphs are definitely curved.\nMost functions are not close to linear-except if you focus all your attention near a single point. That is what we will do.\nOver a very short range a curve looks straight. Look through a microscope, or zoom in with a computer, and there is no doubt. The graph of distance versus time becomes nearly linear. Its slope is the velocity at that moment. We want to find the line that the graph stays closest to-the\n\"tangent linew-before it curves away.\nThe tangent line is easy to describe. We are at a particular point on the graph of y =f (x). At that point x equals a and y equals f (a) and the slope equals f '(a).\nThe tangent line goes through that point x = a, y =f (a) with that slope m = fl(a).\nFigure 2.5 shows the line more clearly than any equation, but we have to turn the geometry into algebra. We need the equation of the line.\nEXAMPLE 1 Suppose y = x4 -x2+ 3. At the point x = a = 1, the height is y =f(a)= 3.\nThe slope is dyldx = 4x3 - 2x. At x = 1 the slope is 4 - 2 = 2. That is fl(a):\nThe numbers x = 1, y = 3, dyldx = 2 determine the tangent line.\nThe equation of the tangent line is y - 3 = 2(x - l), and this section explains why.\nFig. 2.5 The tangent line has the same slope 2 as the curve (especially after zoom).\nTHE EQUATION OF A LINE A straight line is determined by two conditions. We know the line if we know two of its points. (We still have to write down the equation.) Also, if we know one point and the slope, the line is set. That is the situation for the tangent line, which has a known slope at a known point:\n1. The equation of a line has the form y = mx + b 2. The number m is the slope of the line, because dyldx = m 3. The number b adjusts the line to go through the required point.\nI will take those one at a time-first y = mx + b, then m, then b.\n1. The graph of y = mx + b is not curved. How do we know? For the specific example y = 2x + 1, take two points whose coordinates x, y satisfy the equation:\nx=O, y = 1 and x = 4 , y = 9 both satisfy y = 2x+ 1.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 65, "section_id": "s0004-2pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The point halfway between has x = 2 and y = 5. That point also satisfies y = 2x + 1. The halfway point is on the graph. If we subdivide again, the midpoint between (0, 1) and (2, 5) is (1, 3). This also has y = 2x + 1. The graph contains all halfway points and must be straight.\n2. What is the correct slope m for the tangent line? In our example it is m =f '(a) = 2.\nThe curve and its tangent line have the same slope at the crucial point: dyldx = 2.\nAllow me to say in another way why the line y = mx + b has slope m. At x = 0 its height is y = b. At x = 1 its height is y = m + b. The graph has gone one unit across\n(0 to 1) and m units up (b to m + b). The whole idea is distance up m\n- slope = distance across 1 ' Each unit across means m units up, to 2m + b or 3m + b. A straight line keeps a constant slope, whereas the slope of y = x4 - x2 + 3 equals 2 only at x = 1.\n3. Finally we decide on b. The tangent line y = 2x + b must go through x = 1, y = 3.\nTherefore b = 1. With letters instead of numbers, y = mx + b leads to f (a) = ma + b.\nSo we know b:\n2E The equation of the tangent line has b =f (a)- ma:\ny=mx+f(a)-ma or y-f(a)=m(x-a).\n(2)I That last form is the best. You see immediately what happens at x = a. The factor x - a is zero. Therefore y =f (a) as required. This is the point-slope form of the equation, and we use it constantly:\ny - 3 - distance up y - 3 = 2 ( x - 1 ) or\n--\n= sbpe 2.\nx - 1 distance across EXAMPLE 2 The curve y = x3 - 2 goes through y = 6 when x = 2. At that point dyldx = 3x2= 12. The point-slope equation of the tangent line uses 2 and 6 and 12:\ny - 6 = 12(x-2), which is also y= 12x- 18.\nThere is another important line. It is perpendicular to the tangent line and perpendicular to the curve. This is the normal line in Figure 2.6. Its new feature is its slope.\nWhen the tangent line has slope m, the normal line has slope -llm. (Rule: Slopes of tangent line:\ndistance A track\n:a' + 4\n.*' your speed is V\n/ 4 T 1 Fig. 2.6 Tangent line y -yo = m(x - x,). Normal line y -yo = --(x -x,).

Example 2 has m = 12, so the normal line has slope - 1/ 12:\ntangent line: y - 6 = 12(x- 2) normal line: y - 6 = - &(x - 2).\nLight rays travel in the normal direction. So do brush fires-they move perpendicular to the fire line. Use the point-slope form!

Where do you step off?\nSolution Your path will be the tangent line (at high speed). The problem is to choose x = a so the tangent line passes through x = 0, y = 0. When you step off at x = a, the height is y = a2+ 4 and the slope is 2a the equation of the tangent line is y - (a2+ 4)= 2a(x - a) this line goes through (0,O)if - (a2+ 4)= - 2a2 or a = + 2.\nThe same problem is solved by spacecraft controllers and baseball pitchers. Releasing a ball at the right time to hit a target 60 feet away is an amazing display of calculus.\nQuarterbacks with a moving target should read Chapter 4 on related rates.\nHere is a better example than a roller-coaster. Stopping at a red light wastes gas.\nIt is smarter to slow down early, and then accelerate. When a car is waiting in front of you, the timing needs calculus:\nEXAMPLE 4 How much must you slow down when a red light is 72 meters away?\nIn 4 seconds it will be green. The waiting car will accelerate at 3 meters/sec2. You cannot pass the car.\nStrategy Slow down immediately to the speed V at which you will just catch that car. (If you wait and brake later, your speed will have to go below V.)At the catchup time T, the cars have the same speed and same distance. Two conditions, so the distance functions in Figure 2.6d are tangent.\nSolution At time T, the other car's speed is 3 ( T - 4). That shows the delay of 4 seconds. Speeds are equal when 3(T- 4)= V or T = V + 4. Now require equal distances. Your distance is V times T. The other car's distance is 72 + $at2:\n7 2 + 5 3 ( ~ - 4 ) ~ = V Tbecomes 7 2 + f - f - v 2 = V ( 3 V + 4 ) .\nThe solution is V = 12 meters/second. This is 43 km/hr or 27 miles per hour.\nWithout the other car, you only slow down to V = 7214 = 18 meters/second. As the light turns green, you go through at 65 km/hr or 40 miles per hour. Try it.\nTHE SECANT LINE CONNECTING TWO POINTS ON A CURVE Instead of the tangent line through one point, consider the secant line through two points. For the tangent line the points came together. Now spread them apart. The point-slope form of a linear equation is replaced by the two-point form.\nThe equation of the curve is still y =f (x). The first point remains at x = a, y =f (a).\nThe other point is at x = c, y =f (c). The secant line goes between them. and we want its equation.

This line automatically goes through the second point (3,25). Check: 25 - 6 equals 19(3-2). The secant has the right slope 19 to reach the second point. It is the average slope AylAx.\nA look ahead The second point is going to approach the first point. The secant slope AylAx will approach the tangent slope dyldx. We discover the derivative (in the limit). That is the main point now-but not forever.\nSoon you will be fast at derivatives. The exact dyldx will be much easier than AylAx. The situation is turned around as soon as you know that x9 has slope 9x8. Near x = 1, the distance up is about 9 times the distance across. To find Ay = l.0019- 19,just multiply Ax = .001 by 9. The quick approximation is .009, the calculator gives Ay = .009036. It is easier to follow the tangent line than the curve.\nCome back to the secant line, and change numbers to letters. What line connects x = a, y =f (a) to x = c, y =f (c)? A mathematician puts formulas ahead of numbers, and reasoning ahead of formulas, and ideas ahead of reasoning:\n(1) The slope is m = distance up - f (c)-f (a) distance across c - a\n(2) The height is y =f (a) at x = a\n(3) The height is y =f (c) at x = c (automatic with correct slope).\nThe t f ~ v a ruses the slope between the f4d -f@\n(3) c-a At x = a the right side is zero. So y =f (a) on the left side. At x = c the right side has two factors c - a. They cancel to leave y =f (c). With equation (2) for the tangent line and equation (3) for the secant line, we are ready for the moment of truth.\nTHE SECANT LlNE APPROACHES THE TANGENT LlNE What comes now is pretty basic.

One is to compute the derivatives of sin x and cos x.\nThe other is to explain why these functions are so important. They describe oscillation, which will be expressed in words and equations. You will see a \"di~erential equation.\" It involves the derivative of an unknown function y(x).\nThe differential equation will say that the second derivative-the derivative of the derivative-is equal and opposite to y. In symbols this is y\" = - y. Distance in one direction leads to acceleration in the other direction. That makes y and y' and y\" all oscillate. The solutions to y\" = - y are sin x and cos x and all their combinations.\nWe begin with the slope. The derivative of y = sin x is y' = cos x.

Mathematics will prove that the limit is cos x exactly, when Ax -, 0. Curiously, the reasoning concentrates on only one point (x = 0). The slope at that point is cos 0= 1.\nWe now prove this: sin Ax divided by Ax goes to 1. The sine curve starts with slope 1. By the addition formula for sin (x + h), this answer at one point will lead to the slope cos x at all points.\nQuestion Why does the graph of f(x + Ax) shift left from f (x) when Ax > O?\nAnswer When x = 0, the shifted graph is already showing f (Ax). In Figure 2.9a, the red graph is shifted left from the black graph. The red graph shows sin h when the black graph shows sin 0.\nTHE LIMIT OF (sin h)/h IS 4 There are several ways to find this limit. The direct approach is to let a computer draw a graph. Figure 2.10a is very convincing. The function (sin h)/h approaches 1at the key point h = 0. So does (tan h)/h. In practice, the only danger is that you might get a message like \"undefined function\" and no graph. (The machine may refuse to divide by zero at h = 0. Probably you can get around that.)

The ratio (sin h)/h is squeezed between cos h and 1.\nBut cos h is approaching I! The squeeze as h + 0 leaves only one possibility for\n(sin h)/h, which is caught in between: The ratio (sin h)/h approaches 1.\nFigure 2.10 shows that \"squeeze play.\" lftwo functions approach the same limit, so does any function caught in between. This is proved at the end of Section 2.6.\nFor negative values of h, which are absolutely allowed, the result is the same. To the left of zero, h reverses sign and sin h reverses sign. The ratio (sin h)/h is unchanged.\n(The sine is an odd function: sin (- h) = - sin h.) The ratio is an even function, symmetric around zero and approaching 1 from both sides.\nThe proof depends on sin h < h < tan h, which is displayed by the graph but not explained. We go back to right triangles.\nFig. 2.11 Line shorter than arc: 2 sin h < 2h. Areas give h < tan h.\nFigure 2.11a shows why sin h < h. The straight line PQ has length 2 sin h. The circular arc must be longer, because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.? The arc PQ has length 2h. (Important: When the radius is 1, the arc length equals the angle. The full circumference is 2n and the full angle is also 2n.) The straight distance 2 sin h is less than the circular distance 2h, so sin h < h.\nFigure 2.1 1b shows why h < tan h. This time we look at areas. The triangular area is f(base)(height)= i(l)(tan h). Inside that triangle is the shaded sector of the circle.\nIts area is h/2n times the area of the whole circle (because the angle is that fraction of the whole angle). The circle has area nr2 = n, so multiplication by h/2n gives fh for the area of the sector. Comparing with the triangle around it, f tan h > fh.\nThe inequalities sin h < h < tan h are now proved.

This is a basic purpose of calculus-to find simple approximations like $h2. A \"tangent parabola\" 1 - $h2 is close to the top of the cosine curve.\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF THE COSINE This will be easy. The quick way to differentiate cos x is to shift the sine curve by xl2.That yields the cosine curve (solid line in Figure 2.12b).The derivative also shifts by 4 2 (dotted line). The derivative of cos x is -sin x.\nNotice how the dotted line (the slope) goes below zero when the solid line turns downward. The slope equals zero when the solid line is level.

That is important, and we return to it.\nThere is more information in dyldx than \"function rising\" or \"function falling.\" The slope tells how quickly the function goes up or down.

The second derivative is the \"rate of change of the velocity.\" A straight line has constant slope (constant velocity), so its second derivative is zero:\nf (t) = 5t has df /dt = 5 and d2f /dt2 = 0.\nThe parabola y = x2 has slope 2x (linear) which has slope 2 (constant). Similarly f(t)=rat2 has df/dt=at and d2f/dt2=a.\nThere stands the notation d2f/dt2 (or d2y/dx2) for the second derivative. A short form is f \" or y\". (This is pronounced f double prime or y double prime). Example:\nThe second derivative of y = x3 is y\" = 6x.\nIn the distance-velocity problem, f \" is acceleration. It tells how fast v is changing, while v tells how fast f is changing. Where df/dt was distanceltime, the second derivative is di~tance/(time)~.\nThe acceleration due to gravity is about 32 ft/sec2 or 9.8 m/sec2, which means that v increases by 32 ftlsec in one second. It does not mean that the distance increases by 32 feet!\nThe graph of y = sin t increases at the start. Its derivative cos t is positive. However the second derivative is -sin t. The curve is bending down while going up. The arch is \"concave down\" because y\" = - sin t is negative.\nAt t = n the curve reaches zero and goes negative. The second derivative becomes positive. Now the curve bends upward. The lower arch is \"concave up.\" y\" > 0 means that y' increases so y bends upward (concave up) y\" < 0 means that y' decreases so y bends down (concave down).\nChapter 3 studies these things properly-here we get an advance look for sin t.\nThe remarkable fact about the sine and cosine is that y\" = -y. That is unusual and special: acceleration = -distance. The greater the distance, the greater the force pulling back:\ny = sin t has dy/dt = + cos t and d2y/dt2= - sin t = - y.\ny = cos t has dy/dt = - sin t and d y/dt2 = - cos t = - y.\nQuestion Does d2y/dt2 < 0 mean that the distance y(t) is decreasing?\nAnswer No. Absolutely not! It means that dy/dt is decreasing, not necessarily y.\nAt the start of the sine curve, y is still increasing but y\" < 0.\nSines and cosines give simple harmonic motion-up and down, forward and back, out and in, tension and compression.

It is also an important section, containing most of the working tools of differential calculus.

That is tremendously simple, but it is fundamental. The interpretation for distances may be more confusing (and more interesting) than the rule itself:\nSuppose a train moves with velocity 1. The distance at time t is t. On the train a professor paces back and forth (in simple harmonic motion). His distance from his seat is sin t. Then the total distance from his starting point is t + sin t, and his velocity (train speed plus walking speed) is 1 + cos t.\nIf you add distances, you add velocities. Actually that example is ridiculous, because the professor's maximum speed equals the train speed (= 1). He is running like mad, not pacing. Occasionally he is standing still with respect to the ground.\nThe sum rule is a special case of a bigger rule called \"linearity.\" It applies when we add or subtract functions and multiply them by constants-as in 3x -4 sin x. By linearity the derivative is 3 - 4 cos x. The rule works for all functions u(x) and v(x).\nA linear combination is y(x) = au(x) + bv(x), where a and b are any real numbers.\nThen AylAx is", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 78, "section_id": "s0004-2pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The rule for uvw would be in three dimensions.\nThe extra area comes from the whole top strip plus the side strip. By algebra, This increase is u(x + h)Av + v(x)Au-top plus side. Now divide by h (or Ax) and let h + 0. The left side of equation (4) becomes the derivative of u(x)v(x). The right side becomes u(x) times dvldx-we can multiply the two limits-plus v(x) times duldx.\nThat proves the product rule-definitely useful.\nWe could go immediately to the quotient rule for u(x)/v(x). But start with u = 1.\nThe derivative of l/x is - 1/x2 (known). What is the derivative of l/v(x)?\nReciprocal Rule 1\n- dvldx The derivative of ---- is --- 44 u2\n- The proof starts with (v)(l/v) = 1. The derivative of 1 is 0. Apply the product rule:\nd 1 1dv\n- dvldx\n(\n-\n)\n+\n= O dx v v dx sothat \"(A)=- dx v v2\n' It is worth checking the units-in the reciprocal rule and others. A test of dimensions is automatic in science and engineering, and a good idea in mathematics. The test ignores constants and plus or minus signs, but it prevents bad errors. If v is in dollars and x is in hours, dv/dx is in dollars per hour. Then dimensions agree:\n- dvldx dollars/hour and also - w hour v\n dollar^)^ From this test, the derivative of l/v cannot be l/(dv/dx). A similar test shows that Einstein's formula e = mc2 is dimensionally possible. The theory of relativity might be correct!

We divide by cos x, once for the tangent and twice for its slope. The slope of l/x is -l/x2.

It is true that we have survived this far without one, and we could continue. But this seems a reasonable time to define limits more carefully. The goal is to achieve rigor without rigor mortis.\nFirst you should know that limits of Ay/Ax are by no means the only limits in mathematics. Here are five completely different examples. They involve n + a,not Ax +0:\n1. a, = (n - 3)/(n + 3) (for large n, ignore the 3's and find a, + 1) 2. a, =)a,-, + 4 (start with any a, and always a, +8) 3. an=probability of living to year n (unfortunately an +0) 4. a, = fraction of zeros among the first n digits of n (an+h?) 5. a, = .4, a2 = .49, a, = .493, .... No matter what the remaining decimals are, the a's converge to a limit. Possibly a, +.493000 . . .,but not likely.\nThe problem is to say what the limit symbol\n+ really means.\nA good starting point is to ask about convergence to zero. When does a sequence of positive numbers approach zero? What does it mean to write an +O? The numbers a,, a,, a,, ..., must become \"small,\" but that is too vague. We will propose four definitions of convergence to zero, and I hope the right one will be clear.\n1. All the numbers a, are below 10- lo. That may be enough for practical purposes, but it certainly doesn't make the a, approach zero.\n2. The sequence is getting closer to zero-each a,, is smaller than the preceding a,. This test is met by 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, ... which converges to 1 instead of 0.\n3. For any small number you think of, at least one of the an's is smaller. That pushes something toward zero, but not necessarily the whole sequence. The condition would be satisfied by 1, ),1, f, 1, i,. . . ,which does not approach zero.\n4. For any small number you think of, the an's eventually go below that number and stay below. This is the correct definition.\nI want to repeat that. To test for convergence to zero, start with a small numbersay 10-lo. The an's must go below that number. They may come back up and go below again-the first million terms make absolutely no difference. Neither do the next billion, but eventually all terms must go below lo-''.\nAfter waiting longer\n(possibly a lot longer), all terms drop below The tail end of the sequence decides everything.\nQuestion 1 Doesthesequence lo-,, 1 0 - ~ , 1 0 - ~ ,\n...approacho?\nAnswer Yes.

Convergence to zero means that the sequence eventually goes below E and stays there. The smaller the E, the tougher the test and the longer we wait. Think of E as the tolerance, and keep reducing it.\nTo emphasize that E comes from outside, Socrates can choose it. Whatever E he proposes, the a's must eventually be smaller. After some a,, all the a's are below the tolerance E. Here is the exact statement:\nfor any E there is an N such that a, < E if n > N.\nOnce you see that idea, the rest is easy. Figure 2.17 has N = 3 and then N = 6.\nEXAMPLE I The sequence f, $, 8, . . . starts upward but goes to zero. Notice that 1,4,9, . . . , 100, . . . are squares, and 2,4, 8, . . . , 1024, . . . are powers of 2. Eventually 2\" grows faster than n2, as in alo = 100/1024. The ratio goes below any E.\nEXAMPLE 2 1, 0, f, 0, f, 0, . . . approaches zero. These a's do not decrease steadily\n(the mathematical word for steadily is monotonica ally\") but still their limit is zero.\nThe choice E = 1 / 1 0 produces the right response: Beyond azool all terms are below 1/1000. So N = 2001 for that E.\nThe sequence 1, f, f, 4,f, f, . . . is much slower-but it also converges to zero.\nNext we allow the numbers a, to be negative as well as positive. They can converge upward toward zero, or they can come in from both sides. The test still requires the a, to go inside any strip near zero (and stay there). But now the strip starts at -E.\nThe distance from zero is the absolute value la,l. Therefore a, -,0 means lanl + 0.\nThe previous test can be applied to lanl:\nfor any E there is an N such that la,l < E if n > N.\nEXAMPLE 3 1, -f, f , -4,. . . converges to zero because 1, f,f,$, . . . converges to zero.\nIt is a short step to limits other than zero. The limit is L if the numbers a, - L converge to Zero. Our final test applies to the absolute value la, -LI:\nfor any E there is an N such that (a, - L(< E if n > N.\nThis is the definition of convergence! Only a finite number of a's are outside any strip around L (Figure 2.18). We write a, -,L or lim -a,= L or limn,, a, = L.\nFig. 2.18 a, -,0in Example 3;a, -* 1 in Example 4;a, -, rn in Example 5(buta,,, -a, -,0).", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 86, "section_id": "s0004-2pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

But those numbers a,, a,, a3, a,, . . . go past any proposed limit L. The second term is 15. The fourth term adds on 3 + 4, so a, goes past 2. The eighth term has four new fractions 4 + &+ f + $, totaling more than $ + $ + $ + & = 3. Therefore a, exceeds 23. Eight more terms will add more than 8 times &, so a,, is beyond 3. The lines in Figure 2.18~ are infinitely long, not stopping at any L.\nIn the language of Chapter 10, the harmonic series 1 + 3 + 3 + does not converge.\nThe sum is infinite, because the \"partial sums\" a, go beyond every limit L (a,,,, is past L = 9). We will come back to infinite series, but this example makes a subtle point: The steps between the a, can go to zero while still a, -, a.\nThus the condition a,+, - a, -, 0 is not suficient for convergence. However this condition is necessary. If we do have convergence, then a,,, - a, -, 0. That is a good exercise in the logic of convergence, emphasizing the difference between \"sufficient\" and \"necessary.\" We discuss this logic below, after proving that [statement A] implies\n[statement B]:\nIf [a, converges to L] then [a,+ , - a, converges to zero].\n(1) Proof Because the a, converge, there is a number N beyond which (a, - L( < s and also la, + , - LI < E. Since a, +, - a, is the sum of a, +, - L and L - a,, its absolute value cannot exceed E + E = 2s. Therefore a,+ , - a, approaches zero.\nObjection by Socrates: We only got below 2s and he asked for s. Our reply: If he particularly wants la, + , - a, 1 < 1/ 10, we start with s = 1/20. Then 2s = 1/10. But this juggling is not necessary.

In that case lim,,, f (x) = L. Or we write f (x) -, L as x -, a.\nThe statement is awkward because it involves two limits. The limit x + a is forcing f (x) + L. (Previously n + co forced a, + L.) But it is wrong to expect the same E in both limits. We do not and cannot require that Jx - a1 < E produces ) f (x) - LI < E.\nIt may be necessary to push x extremely close to a (closer than E). We must guarantee that if x is close enough to a, then If (x) - LI < E.\nWe have come to the \"epsilon-delta definition\" of limits. First, Socrates chooses E.\nHe has to be shown that f (x) is within E of L, for every x near a. Then somebody else (maybe Plato) replies with a number 6. That gives the meaning of \"near a.\" Plato's goal is to get f(x) within E of L, by keeping x within 6 of a:\nif 0 < lx - a1 < S then\n(f(x) - LI < E.\n(3) The input tolerance is 6 (delta), the output tolerance is E. When Plato can find a 6 for every E, Socrates concedes that the limit is L.\nEXAMPLE Prove that lim 5x = 10. In this case a = 2 and L = 10.\nx+2 Socrates asks for 15x - 101 < E. Plato responds by requiring Ix - 21 < 6. What 6 should he choose? In this case 15x - 101 is exactly 5 times Jx - 21. So Plato picks 6 below ~ / 5\n(a smaller 6 is always OK). Whenever Jx - 21 < 45, multiplication by 5 shows that 15x - 101 < E.\nRemark 1 In Figure 2.19, Socrates chooses the height of the box. It extends above and below L, by the small number E. Second, Plato chooses the width. He must make the box narrow enough for the graph to go out the sides. Then If (x) - Ll< E.\n1 limit L is not f(o) f(x) = step function I I Fig. 2.19 S chooses height 2.5, then P chooses width 26.

A step function has no limit as x approaches the jump, because the graph goes through the top or bottom-no matter how thin the box.\nRemark 2 The second figure has f (x) +L, because in taking limits we ignore the Jinalpoint x = a. The value f (a) can be anything, with no effect on L. The first figure has more: f(a) equals L. Then a special name applies- f is continuous.The left figure shows a continuous function, the other figures do not.\nWe soon come back to continuous functions.\nRemark 3 In the example with f = 5x and 6 = 45, the number 5 was the slope. That choice barely kept the graph in the box-it goes out the corners. A little narrower, say 6 = ~110, and the graph goes safely out the sides. A reasonable choice is to divide E by 21 ff(a)l. (We double the slope for safety.) I want to say why this 6 works-even if the E-6 test is seldom used in practice.\nThe ratio off (x) - L to x -a is distance up over distance across. This is Af/Ax, close to the slope f'(a). When the distance across is 6, the distance up or down is near 61 ff(a)l. That equals ~ / 2 for our \"reasonable choice\" of 6-so we are safely below E. This choice solves most exercises. But Example 7 shows that a limit might exist even when the slope is infinite.\nEXAMPLE 7 lim ,/x - 1 = 0 (a one-sided limit).\nx+1+ Notice the plus sign in the symbol x + 1+ . The number x approaches a = 1 only from above. An ordinary limit x + 1 requires us to accept x on both sides of 1 (the exact value x = 1 is not considered). Since negative numbers are not allowed by the square root, we have a one-sided limit. It is L = 0.\nSuppose E is 1/10. Then the response could be 6 = 1/100. A number below 1/100 has a square root below 1/10. In this case the box must be made extremely narrow, 6 much smaller than E, because the square root starts with infinite slope.\nThose examples show the point of the 6-6 definition. (Given E, look for 6. This came from Cauchy in France, not Socrates in Greece.) We also see its bad feature:\nThe test is not convenient. Mathematicians do not go around proposing 8's and replying with 8's. We may live a strange life, but not that strange.\nIt is easier to establish once and for all that 5x approaches its obvious limit 5a.\nThe same is true for other familiar functions: xn+an and sin x +sin a and\n(1 - x)-' -t (1 - a)- '-except at a = 1. The correct limit L comes by substituting x = a into the function. This is exactly the property of a \"continuous function.\" Before the section on continuous functions, we prove the Squeeze Theorem using E and 6.\nProof g(x) is squeezed between f (x) and h(x). After subtracting L, g(x) - L is between f(x) -L and h(x) - L. Therefore Ig(x) - LI < E if If(x) -L(< E and Ih(x)- LJ < E.\nFor any E, the last two inequalities hold in some region 0 < Jx- a1 < 6. So the first one also holds. This proves that g(x) +L.

It was originally included with limits, but the combination was too long. We are still concerned with the limit off (x) as x -,a, but a new number is involved. That number is f (a), the value off at x =a. For a \"limit,\" x approached a but never reached it-so f(a) was ignored. For a \"continuous function,\" this final number f (a) must be right.\nMay I summarize the usual (good) situation as x approaches a?\n1. The number f (a) exists\n(f is defined at a) 2. The limit of f (x) exists\n(it was called L) 3. The limit L equals f (a) (f (a) is the right value) In such a case, f (x) is continuous at x = a. These requirements are often written in a single line: f (x) +f (a) as x -,a.

But it has f(0) = 1. After changing f (0) to the right value, the problem is gone. The discontinuity is removable. Examples 2, 3, 4 are more important and more serious. There is no\n\"correct\" value for f (0):\n2. f (x) = step function (jump from 0 to 1 at x = 0) 3. f (x) = 1/x2 (infinite limit as x +0) 4. f (x) = sin (1/x) (infinite oscillation as x +0).\nThe graphs show how the limit fails to exist. The step function has a jump discontinuity. It has one-sided limits, from the left and right. It does not have an ordinary (twosided) limit. The limit from the left (x +0-) is 0. The limit from the right (x +0') is 1. Another step function is x/lxl, which jumps from -1 to 1.\nIn the graph of l/x2, the only reasonable limit is L= + co.I cannot go on record as saying that this limit exists. Officially, it doesn't-but we often write it anyway:\nl/x2+ m as x +0. This means that l/x2 goes (and stays) above every L as x +0.\nIn the same unofficial way we write one-sided limits for f (x)= l/x:\n1 1 From the left, lim - = - co. From the right, lim - = + oo.\n(1) x+o- x x+o+ X Remark l/x has a \"pole\" at x = 0. So has l/x2 (a double pole). The function l/(x2 - X) has poles at x = 0 and x = 1. In each case the denominator goes to zero and the function goes to + oo or -oo. Similarly llsin x has a pole at every multiple of n (where sin x is zero). Except for l/x2 these poles are \"simplew-the functions are completely smooth at x = 0 when we multiply them by x:\n1 and ( )(A)are continuous at x =0.\n(x)(!-)\n=1 and (x) l/x2 has a double pole, since it needs multiplication by x2 (not just x). A ratio of polynomials P(x)/Q(x) has poles where Q = 0, provided any common factors like\n(X + 1)/(x+ 1) are removed first.\nJumps and poles are the most basic discontinuities, but others can occur. The fourth graph shows that sin(l/x) has no limit as x +0. This function does not blow up; the sine never exceeds 1. At x = 4 and $ and &it equals sin 3 and sin 4 and sin 1000. Those numbers are positive and negative and (?). As x gets small and l/x gets large, the sine oscillates faster and faster. Its graph won't stay in a small box of height E, no matter how narrow the box.\nCONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS DEFINITION f is \"continuous at x = a\" if f(a) is defined and f (x) 4f (a) as x -,a.\nIff is continuous at every point where it is defined, it is a continuous function.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 93, "section_id": "s0004-2pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

It is not defined at x = 0, so its continuity can't fail. The logic requires us to accept this, but we don't have to like it. Certainly there is no f(0) that would make 1lx continuous at x = 0.\nIt is amazing but true that the definition of \"continuous function\" is still debated\n(Mathematics Teacher, May 1989). You see the reason-we speak about a discontinuity of l/x, and at the same time call it a continuous function. The definition misses the difference between 1/x and (sin x)/x. The function f(x) = (sin x)/x can be made continuousat all x. Just set f(0) = 1.\nWe call a function \"continuable'iif its definition can be extended to all x in a way that makes it continuous. Thus (sin x)/x and \\/;\nare continuable. The functions l/x and tan x are not continuable. This suggestion may not end the debate, but I hope it is helpful.\nEXAMPLE sin x and cos x and all polynomials P(x) are continuous functions.\nEXAMPLE 2 The absolute value Ixl is continuous. Its slope jumps (not continuable).\nEXAMPLE3 Any rational function P(x)/Q(x) is continuous except where Q = 0.\nEXAMPLE4 The function that jumps between 1 at fractions and 0 at non-fractions is discontinuous everywhere. There is a fraction between every pair of non-fractions and vice versa. (Somehow there are many more non-fractions.) EXAMPLE5 The function 02 is zero for every x, except that 00 is not defined. So define it as zero and this function is continuous. But see the next paragraph where 00 has to be 1.\nWe could fill the book with proofs of continuity, but usually the situation is clear.\n\"A function is continuous if you can draw its graph without lifting up your pen.\" At a jump, or an infinite limit, or an infinite oscillation, there is no way across the discontinuity except to start again on the other side. The function x\" is continuous for n > 0. It is not continuable for n < 0. The function x0 equals 1 for every x, except that 00 is not defined. This time continuity requires 00 = 1.\nThe interesting examples are the close ones-we have seen two of them:\nsin x 1 -cos x EXAMPLE6 and are both continuable at x = 0.\nx x Those were crucial for the slope of sin x. The first approaches 1 and the second approaches 0. Strictly speaking we must give these functions the correct values\n(1 and 0) at the limiting point x = O-which of course we do.\nIt is important to know what happens when the denominators change to x2.\nsin x 1 -cos x 1 EXAMPLE7 blows up but has the limit at x = 0.\nX2 2 Since (sin x)/x approaches 1, dividing by another x gives a function like 1lx. There is a simple pole. It is an example of 0/0, in which the zero from x2 is reached more quickly than the zero from sin x.

A central question of differential calculus is to know how fast the limit is approached. The speed of approach is exactly the information in the derivative.\nThese three examples are all continuous at x = 0.

So f (x + Ax) -f (x) -+ 0.\nThe continuous function x113has no derivative at x = 0, because +xw2I3blows up.\nThe absolute value 1x1 has no derivative because its slope jumps.

To most people, it belongs with space-filling curves and unmeasurable areas-in a box of curiosities. Fractals used to go into the same box! They are beautiful shapes, with boundaries that have no tangents.

This chapter concentrates on using them. Our computations produced dyldx for functions built from xn and sin x and cos x. Knowing the slope, and if necessary also the second derivative, we can answer the questions about y =f(x) that this subject was created for:\n1. How does y change when x changes?\n2. What is the maximum value of y? Or the minimum?\n3. How can you tell a maximum from a minimum, using derivatives?\nThe information in dyldx is entirely local. It tells what is happening close to the point and nowhere else. In Chapter 2, Ax and Ay went to zero. Now we want to get them back. The local information explains the larger picture, because Ay is approximately dyldx times Ax.\nThe problem is to connect the finite to the infinitesimal-the average slope to the instantaneous slope. Those slopes are close, and occasionally they are equal. Points of equality are assured by the Mean Value Theorem-which is the local-global connection at the center of differential calculus. But we cannot predict where dyldx equals AylAx. Therefore we now find other ways to recover a function from its derivatives-or to estimate distance from velocity and acceleration.\nIt may seem surprising that we learn about y from dyldx. All our work has been going the other way! We struggled with y to squeeze out dyldx. Now we use dyldx to study y. That's life. Perhaps it really is life, to understand one generation from later generations.\n3.1 Linear Approximation The book started with a straight line f = vt.

They do for the approximation Y(x) exactly what Ax and Ay did for y(x). Thus dx and Ax both measure distance across.\nFigure 3.2 has Ax =dx. But the change in y does not equal the change in Y. One is Ay (exact for the function). The other is dy (exact for the tangent line). The differential dy is equal to AY, the change along the tangent line.

We begin with two quick questions.\nIf dfldx is positive, what does that say about f ? If the slope is negative, how is that reflected in the function? Then the third question is the critical one:\nHow do you identify a maximum or minimum?\nNormal answer: The slope is zero.\nThis may be the most important application of calculus, to reach df1d.x = 0.\nTake the easy questions first. Suppose dfldx is positive for every x between a and b.\nAll tangent lines slope upward. The function f(x) is increasing as x goes from n to b.\n3B If dfldx > 0 then f(x) is increasing. If dfldx < 0 then f(x) is decreasing.\nTo define increasing and decreasing, look at any two points x < X. \"Increasing\" requires f(x) < f(X). \"Decreasing\" requires j(x) > f(X). A positive slope does not mean a positive function. The function itself can be positive or negative.\nEXAMPLE 1 f(x) = x2 - 2x has slope 2x - 2.

All functions with slope 2x - 2 are parabolas x2 - 2x + C, shifted up or down according to C. Some parabolas cross the x axis (those crossings are solutions to f(x) = 0). Other parabolas stay above the axis. The solutions to x2 - 2x + 5 = 0 are complex numbers and we don't see them. The special parabola x2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)2grazes the axis at x = 1. It has a \"double zero,\" where f(x) = dfldx = 0.\nEXAMPLE 3 Suppose dfldx = (x- l)(x- 2)(x- 3)(x- 4). This slope is positive beyond x = 4 and up to x = 1 (dfldx = 24 at x = 0). And dfldx is positive again between 2 and 3. At x = 1, 2, 3,4, this slope is zero and f(x) changes direction.\nHere f(x) is a fifth-degree polynomial, because f '(x)is fourth-degree. The graph of f goes up-down-up-down-up. It might cross the x axis five times. It must cross at least once (like this one). When complex numbers are allowed, every fifth-degree polynomial has five roots.\nYou may feel that \"positive slope implies increasing function\" is obvious-perhaps it is. But there is still something delicate. Starting from dfldx > 0 at every single point, we have to deduce f ( X ) >f(x) at pairs of points. That is a \"local to global\" question, to be handled by the Mean Value Theorem. It could also wait for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: The diflerence f ( X ) -f(x) equals the area under the graph of dfldx. That area is positive, so f ( X ) exceeds f(x).\nMAXIMA AND MINIMA Which x makesf(x) as large as possible? Where is the smallest f(x)?

Its derivative 1 - 1/x2 is zero at x = 1.\nAt that point f(1) = 2 is the minimum value. Every combination like f + 3 or 4 + is larger than fmin = 2. Figure 3.4 shows that the maximum of x + x- ' is + oo.?\nImportant The maximum always occurs at a stationarypoint (where dfldx = 0) or a rough point (no derivative) or an endpoint of the domain. These are the three types of critical points. All maxima and minima occur at critical points! At every other point df/dx > 0 or df/dx < 0. Here is the procedure:\n1. Solve df/dx = 0 to find the stationary points f(x).\n2. Compute f(x) at every critical point-stationary point, rough point, endpoint.\n3. Take the maximum and minimum of those critical values of f(x).\nEXAMPLE 6 (Absolute value f(x) = 1x1) The minimum is zero at a rough point. The maximum is at an endpoint. There are no stationary points.\nThe derivative of y = 1x1 is never zero. Figure 3.4 shows the maximum and minimum on the interval [- 3,2]. This is typical of piecewise linear functions.\nQuestion Could the minimum be zero when the function never reaches f(x) = O?\nAnswer Yes, f(x) = 1/(1+ x ) ~ approaches but never reaches zero as x + oo.\nRemark 1 x + foo and f(x) -, + oo are avoided when f is continuous on a closed interval a < x < b. Then f(x) reaches its maximum and its minimum (Extreme Value Theorem). But x -, oo and f(x) + oo are too important to rule out. You test x + ca by considering large x. You recognize f(x) + oo by going above every finite value.\nRemark 2 Note the difference between critical points (specified by x) and critical values (specified by f(x)). The example x + xhad the minimum point x = 1 and the minimum value f(1) = 2.\nMAXIMUM AND MINIMUM IN APPLICATIONS To find a maximum or minimum, solve f'(x) = 0. The slope is zero at the top and bottom of the graph. The idea is clear-and then check rough points and endpoints.\nBut to be honest, that is not where the problem starts.\nIn a real 'application, the first step (often the hardest) is to choose the unknown and find the function. It is we ourselves who decide on x and f(x). The equation dfldx = 0 comes in the middle of the problem, not at the beginning. I will start on a new example, with a question instead of a function.\nEXAMPLE 7 Where should you get onto an expressway for minimum driving time, if the expressway speed is 60 mph and ordinary driving speed is 30 mph?\nI know this problem well-it comes up every morning. The Mass Pike goes to MIT and I have to join it somewhere. There is an entrance near Route 128 and another entrance further in. I used to take the second one, now I take the first. Mathematics should decide which is faster-some mornings I think they are maxima.\nMost models are simplified, to focus on the key idea. We will allow the expressway to be entered at any point x (Figure 3.5). Instead of two entrances (a discrete problem)\n?A good word is approach when f(x) + a.Infinity is not reached.

A spring is pulled down by a mass, the energy is f(x), and dfldx = 0 gives equilibrium. It is a philosophical question why so many laws of physics involve minimum energy or minimum timewhich makes the mathematics easy.\nThe energy has two terms-for the spring and the mass. The spring energy is\n+kx2-positive in stretching (x > 0 is downward) and also positive in compression\n(x < 0). The potential energy of the mass is taken as -mx-decreasing as the mass goes down. The balance is at the minimum of f(x) = 4 kx2 - mx.\nI apologize for giving you such a small problem, but it makes a crucial point.\nWhen f(x) is quadratic, the equilibrium equation dfldx = 0 is linear.\nGraphically, x = m/k is at the bottom of the parabola. Physically, kx = m is a balance of forces-the spring force against the weight. Hooke's law for the spring force is elastic constant k times displacement x.\nEXAMPLE 9 Derivative of cost = marginal cost (our first management example).\nThe paper to print x copies of this book might cost C = 1000 + 3x dollars. The derivative is dCldx = 3. This is the marginal cost of paper for each additional book.\nIf x increases by one book, the cost C increases by $3. The marginal cost is like the velocity and the total cost is like the distance.\nMarginal cost is in dollars per book. Total cost is in dollars. On the plus side, the income is I(x) and the marginal income is dlldx. To apply calculus, we overlook the restriction to whole numbers.\nSuppose the number of books increases by dx.? The cost goes up by (dCldx) dx.\nThe income goes up by (dlldx) dx. If we skip all other costs, then profit P(x) = income I(x)- cost C(x). In most cases P increases to a maximum and falls back.\nAt the high point on the profit curve, the marginal profit is zero:\nProfit is maximized when marginal income I' equals marginal cost C'.\nThis basic rule of economics comes directly from calculus, and we give an example:\nC(x)= cost of x advertisements = 900 + 400x - x2 setup cost 900, print cost 400x, volume savings x2 I(x)= income due to x advertisements = 600x - 6x2 sales 600 per advertisement, subtract 6x2 for diminishing returns optimal decision dCldx = dI/dx or 400 - 2x = 600 - 12x or x = 20 profit = income - cost = 9600 - 8500 = 1 100.\nThe next section shows how to verify that this profit is a maximum not a minimum.\nThe first exercises ask you to solve dfldx = 0.

The sign off or f' is not revealed by f \". The second derivative tells about change in slope.\nA function with f \"(x)> 0 is concave up. It bends upward as the slope increases. It is also called convex. A function with decreasing slope-this means f \"(x)< 0-is concave down. Note how cos x and 1 + cos x and even 1+ $x + cos x change from concave down to concave up at x = 7~12. At that point f \" = - cos x changes from negative to positive.

Inflection point f\" = 0.\nHere is another way to see the sign off \". Watch the tangent lines. When the curve is concave up, the tangent stays below it. A linear approximation is too low. This section computes a quadratic approximation-which includes the term with f \" > 0.\nWhen the curve bends down (f\" < O), the opposite happens-the tangent lines are above the curve. The linear approximation is too high, and f\" lowers it.\nIn physical motion, f \"(t) is the acceleration-in units of di~tance/(time)~.\nAcceleration is rate of change of velocity. The oscillation sin 2t has v = 2 cos 2t (maximum speed 2) and a = - 4 sin 2t (maximum acceleration 4).\nAn increasing population means f' > 0. An increasing growth rate means f \" > 0.\nThose are different. The rate can slow down while the growth continues.\nMAXIMUM VS. MINIMUM Remember that f '(x) = 0 locates a stationary point. That may be a minimum or a maximum. The second derivative decides! Instead of computing f(x) at many points, we compute f \"(x) at one point-the stationary point. It is a minimum iff \"(x) > 0.\n3D When f'(x) = 0 and f \"(x) > 0, there is a local minimum at x.\nWhen f '(x) = 0 and f\"(x) < 0,there is a local maximrcm at x.\nTo the left of a minimum, the curve is falling. After the minimum, the curve rises. The slope has changed from negative to positive. The graph bends upward and f \"(x)> 0.\nAt a maximum the slope drops from positive to negative. In the exceptional case, when f '(x) = 0 and also f \"(x)= 0, anything can happen. An example is x3, which pauses at x = 0 and continues up (its slope is 3x2 2 0).

When the function isf, its graph crosses the axis. When the function is f', the tangent line is horizontal. When f\" goes through zero, we have an injection point.\nThe direction of bending changes at an inflection point. Your eye picks that out in a graph. For an instant the graph is straight (straight lines have f\" = 0). It is easy to see crossing points and stationary points and inflection points. Very few people can recognize where f \"'= 0 or f '\" = 0. I am not sure if those points have names.\nThere is a genuine maximum or minimum when f '(x) changes sign. Similarly, there is a genuine inflection point when f \"(x) changes sign. The graph is concave down on one side of an inflection point and concave up on the other side.? The tangents are above the curve on one side and below it on the other side. At an inflection point, the tangent line crosses the curve (Figure 3.7b).\nNotice that a parabola y = ax2+ bx + c has no inflection points: y\" is constant.

The world's population seemed set to stabilize around 10.2 billion towards the end of the next century.\nToday, the situation looks less promising. The world has overshot the marker points of the 1984 \"most likely\" medium projection. It is now on course for an eventual total that will be closer to 11 billion than to 10 billion.\nIf fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected, the mark could be missed again. In that case the world could be headed towards a total of up to 14 billion people.\nStarting with a census, the UN follows each age group in each country. They estimate the death rate and fertility rate-the medium estimates are published. This report is saying that we are not on track with the estimate.\nSection 6.5 will come back to population, with an equation that predicts 10 billion.\nIt assumes we are now at the inflection point. But China's second census just started on July 1 , 1990. When it's finished we will know if the inflection point is still ahead.\nYou now understand the meaning off \"(x).Its sign gives the direction of bendingthe change in the slope.

We find quadratic approximations based on fl'(x).In some courses they are optional-the main points are highlighted.\nCENTERED DIFFERENCES AND SECOND DIFFERENCES Calculus begins with average velocities, computed on either side of x:\nWe never mentioned it, but a better approximation to J\"(x)comes from averaging those two averages. This produces a centered difference, which is based on x + Ax and x - Ax. It divides by 2 Ax:\n1 .f(s+ Ax) -f(x) + Y\n) -f\n- A )1 f(-Y+ A X )-f'(x - Ax)\n' f f ( x )z -2 [\n.\n(2) Ax Ax\n= 2 A x We claim this is better. The test is to try it on powers of x.\nFor f(x) = x these ratios all give f' = 1 (exactly). For f(x)= x2, only the centered difference correctly gives f' = 2x. The one-sided ratio gave 2.x + Ax (in Chapter 1 it was 2t + h). It is only \"first-order accurate.\" But centering leaves no error. We are averaging 2x + Ax with 2x - Ax. Thus the centered difference is \"second-order accurate.\" I ask now: What ratio converges to the second derivative? One answer is to take differences of the first derivative. Certainly Af'lAx approaches f \". But we want a ratio involving f itself. A natural idea is to take diflerences of diferences, which brings us to \"second differences\":\nf(x+Ax)-f(x) -f ( 4 - f ( x - A x ) A x Ax Ax\n--f(x + Ax) - 2j'(x) +.f(x - A.Y) . d 2f d s 2\n(3) tThe United Nations watches the second derivative!", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 116, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

It corresponds to d2f.\nOn the bottom, (Ax)2 corresponds to dx2 . This explains the way we place the 2's in d 2f/dx 2. To say it differently: dx is squared, dfis not squared-as in distance/(time) 2.\nNote that (Ax)2 becomes much smaller than Ax. If we divide Af by (Ax)2, the ratio blows up. It is the extra cancellation in the second difference A2fthat allows the limit to exist. That limit is f\"(x).\nApplication The great majority of differential equations can't be solved exactly.\nA typical case is f\"(x) = - sinf(x) (the pendulum equation). To compute a solution, I would replace f\"(x) by the second difference in equation (3). Approximations at points spaced by Ax are a very large part of scientific computing.\nTo test the accuracy of these differences, here is an experiment on f(x)= sin x + cos x.

The other columns decrease like (Ax)2. Each reduction divides those errors by 4. The errors from onesided differences are O(Ax) and the errors from centered differences are O(Ax) 2.\nThe \"big 0\" notation When the errors are of order A x, we write E = O(Ax). This means that E < CAx for some constant C. We don't compute C-in fact we don't want to deal with it. The statement \"one-sided errors are Oh of delta x\" captures what is important. The main point of the other columns is E = O(Ax) 2.\nLINEAR APPROXIMATION VS. QUADRATIC APPROXIMATION The second derivative gives a tremendous improvement over linear approximation f(a) +f'(a)(x - a). A tangent line starts out close to the curve, but the line has no way to bend. After a while it overshoots or undershoots the true function (see Figure 3.8). That is especially clear for the model f(x) = x2, when the tangent is the x axis and the parabola curves upward.\nYou can almost guess the term with bending. It should involve f\", and also (Ax) 2.\nIt might be exactly f\"(x) times (Ax)2 but it is not. The model function x2 hasf\" = 2.\nThere must be a factor 1 to cancel that 2:\nAt the basepoint this is f(a) =f(a). The derivatives also agree at x = a. Furthermore the second derivatives agree. On both sides of (4), the second derivative at x = a is f\"(a).\nThe quadratic approximation bends with the function. It is not the absolutely final word, because there is a cubic term -f\"'(a)(x - a)3 and a fourth-degree term N f\"\"(a)(x - a)4 and so on.

Everything is there, but you have to know what to look for. One way to learn is by sketching graphs yourself, and in the past that was almost the only way. Now it is obsolete to spend weeks drawing curves-a computer or graphing calculator does it faster and better. That doesn't remove the need to appreciate a graph (or a painting), since a curve displays a tremendous amount of information.\nThis section combines two approaches. One is to study actual machine-produced graphs (especially electrocardiograms). The other is to understand the mathematics of graphs-slope, concavity, asymptotes, shifts, and scaling. We introduce the centering transform and zoom transform. These two approaches are like the rest of calculus, where special derivatives and integrals are done by hand and day-to-day applications are by computer. Both are essential-the machine can do experiments that we could never do. But without the mathematics our instructions miss the point.\nTo create good graphs you have to know a few of them personally.\nREADING AN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG or EKG)\n- REFERENCE The graphs of an ECG show the electrical potential during a heartbeat. There are twelve graphs-six from leads attached to the chest, and six from leads to the arms 500 - and left leg. (It doesn't hurt, but everybody is nervous. You have to lie still, because 400contraction of other muscles will mask the reading from the heart.) The graphs record 300electrical impulses, as the cells depolarize and the heart contracts.\n200 - What can I explain in two pages? The graph shows the fundamental pattern of the\n- 175ECG. Note the P wave, the QRS complex, and the T wave. Those patterns, seen v8 150differently in the twelve graphs, tell whether the heart is normal or out of rhythm140130or suffering an infarction (a heart attack).\nro 120N 110Y 100$) 95a 902 85if 00& 75a 3 70I s 65First of all the graphs show the heart rate. The dark vertical lines are by convention 2 60f second apart. The light lines are & second apart. If the heart beats every f second W y 55(one dark line) the rate is 5 beats per second or 300 per minute. That is extreme W Lf tachycardia-not compatible with life. The normal rate is between three dark lines W k 50per beat (2 second, or 100 beats per minute) and five dark lines (one second between a I beats, 60 per minute).

The regular rhythm is set by the pacemaker, which produces the P wave. A constant distance between waves is goodand then each beat is examined. When there is a block in the pathway, it shows as a delay in the graph. Sometimes the pacemaker fires irregularly. Figure 3.10 shows sinus arrythmia (fairly normal). The time between peaks is changing. In disease or emergency, there are potential pacemakers in all parts of the heart.\nI should have pointed out the main parts. We have four chambers, an atriumventricle pair on the left and right. The SA node should be the pacemaker. The stimulus spreads from the atria to the ventricles- from the small chambers that\n\"prime the pump\" to the powerful chambers that drive blood through the body. The P wave comes with contraction of the atria. There is a pause of & second at the AV node. Then the big QRS wave starts contraction of the ventricles, and the T wave is when the ventricles relax. The cells switch back to negative charge and the heart cycle is complete.\nectrodes D ground Fig. 3.9 Happy person with a heart and a normal electrocardiogram.\nThe ECG shows when the pacemaker goes wrong. Other pacemakers take overthe AV node will pace at 60/minute. An early firing in the ventricle can give a wide spike in the QRS complex, followed by a long pause. The impulses travel by a slow path. Also the pacemaker can suddenly speed up (paroxysmal tachycardia is 150-250/minute). But the most critical danger is fibrillation.\nFigure 3.10b shows a dying heart. The ECG indicates irregular contractions-no normal PQRST sequence at all. What kind of heart would generate such a rhythm?\nThe muscles are quivering or \"fibrillating\" independently. The pumping action is nearly gone, which means emergency care. The patient needs immediate CPRsomeone to do the pumping that the heart can't do. Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation is a combination of chest pressure and air pressure (hand and mouth) to restart the rhythm. CPR can be done on the street. A hospital applies a defibrillator, which shocks the heart back to life. It depolarizes all the heart cells, so the timing can be reset. Then the charge spreads normally from SA node to atria to AV node to ventricles.\nThis discussion has not used all twelve graphs to locate the problem. That needs uectors. Look ahead at Section 11.1 for the heart vector, and especially at Section 1 1.2 for its twelve projections. Those readings distinguish between atrium and ventricle, left and right, forward and back. This information is of vital importance in the event of a heart attack. A \"heart attack\" is a myocardial infarction (MI).\nAn MI occurs when part of an artery to the heart is blocked (a coronary occlusion).", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 121, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

A computer has a much better idea of a parabola than an artist (who tends to make it asymptotic to a straight line). There are some things a computer knows, and other things an artist knows, and still others that you and I know-because we understand derivatives.\nOur job is to apply calculus. We extract information from f' and f\" as well asf.\nSmall movements in the graph may go unnoticed, but the important properties come through. Here are the main tests:\n1. The sign off (x)\n(above or below axis: f = 0at crossing point) 2. The sign of f(x)\n(increasing or decreasing: f' = 0 at stationary point) 3. The sign of f\"(x)\n(concave up or down: f\" = 0 at injection point) 4. The behavior of f(x) as x + oo and x -, - oo 5. The points at which f(x) + oo or f(x) -, - oo 6. Even or odd?\nPeriodic?\nJumps in for f '?\nEndpoints?\nf(O)?\nThe sign of f(x) depends on 1 - x2. Thus f(x) > 0 in the inner interval where x2 < 1.\nThe graph bends upwards (f\"(x) > 0) in that same interval. There are no inflection points, since f \" is never zero. The stationary point where f' vanishes is x = 0. We have a local minimum at x = 0.\nThe guidelines (or asymptotes)meet the graph at infinity. For large x the important terms are x2 and -x2.

The slope is zero at x = 2. That must be a local minimum.\nWhat happens as x -+ oo? Dividing x2 by x - 1, the leading term is x. The function becomes large. It grows linearly-we expect a sloping asymptote. To find it, do the division properly:\nThe last term goes to zero. The function approaches y = x + 1 as the asymptote.\nThis function is not odd or even. Its graph is in Figure 3.11b. With zoom out you see the asymptotes.

(The slope at the jump is an infinite spike.) These sums of sines and cosines are Fourier series.\nGRAPHS BY COMPUTERS AND CALCULATORS We have come to a topic of prime importance. If you have graphing software for a computer, or if you have a graphing calculator, you can bring calculus to life. A graph presents y(x) in a new way-different from the formula. Information that is buried in the formula is clear on the graph. But don't throw away y(x) and dyldx. The derivative is far from obsolete.\nThese pages discuss how calculus and graphs go together. We work on a crucial problem of applied mathematics-to find where y(x) reaches its minimum. There is no need to tell you a hundred applications. Begin with the formula. How do you find the point x* where y(x) is smallest?\nFirst, draw the graph. That shows the main features. We should see (roughly) where x* lies. There may be several minima, or possibly none. But what we see depends on a decision that is ours to make-the range of x and y in the viewing window.\nIf nothing is known about y(x), the range is hard to choose. We can accept a default range, and zoom in or out. We can use the autoscaling program in Section 1.7.\nSomehow x* can be observed on the screen. Then the problem is to compute it.\nI would like to work with a specific example. We solved it by calculus-to find the best point x* to enter an expressway. The speeds in Section 3.2 were 30 and 60.\nThe length of the fast road will be b = 6. The range of reasonable values for the entering point is 0 < x <6. The distance to the road in Figure 3.12 is a = 3. We drive a distance\n,/= at speed 30 and the remaining distance 6 - x at speed 60:\n1 driving time y(x)= -1 ,/-\n+ -(6 - x).\n(2) 30 60 This is the function to be minimized. Its graph is extremely flat.\nIt may seem unusual for the graph to be so level. On the contrary, it is common.\nAJat graph is the whole point of dyldx = 0.\nThe graph near the minimum looks like y = cx2. It is a parabola sitting on a horizontal tangent. At a distance of Ax = .01, we only go up by C(AX)~\n= .0001 C.\nUnless C is a large number, this Ay can hardly be seen.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 124, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The graph of driving time y(x). Zoom boxes locate x*.\nThe solution is to change scale. Zoom in on x*. The tangent line stays flat, since dyldx is still zero. But the bending from C is increased. Figure 3.12 shows the zoom box blown up into a new graph of y(x).\nA calculator has one or more ways to find x*. With a TRACE mode, you direct a cursor along the graph. From the display of y values, read y,, and x* to the nearest pixel. A zoom gives better accuracy, because it stretches the axes-each pixel represents a smaller Ax and Ay. The TI-81 stretches by 4 as default. Even better, let the whole process be graphical-draw the actual ZOOM BOX on the screen. Pick two opposite corners, press ENTER, and the box becomes the new viewing window (Figure 3.12).\nThe first zoom narrows the search for x*. It lies between x = 1 and x = 3. We build a new ZOOM BOX and zoom in again. Now 1.5 < x* <2. Reasonable accuracy comes quickly. High accuracy does not come quickly. It takes time to create the box and execute the zoom.\nQuestion 1 What happens as we zoom in, if all boxes are square (equal scaling)?\nAnswer The picture gets flatter and flatter. We are zooming in to the tangent line.\nChanging x to X/4 and y to Y/4, the parabola y =x2 flattens to Y = X2/4. To see any bending, we must use a long thin zoom box.\nI want to change to a totally different approach. Suppose we have a formula for dyldx. That derivative was produced by an infinite zoom! The limit of Ay/Ax came by brainpower alone:\n- dy = X\n--I Call this f(x).\ndx 3 o J m 60' This function is zero at x*. The computing problem is completely changed: Solve Ax) =0. It is easier to find a root of f(x) than a minimum of y(x). The graph of f(x) crosses the x axis. The graph of y(x) goes flat-this is harder to pinpoint.\nTake the model function y =x2 for 1x1 c .01. The slope f =2x changes from -.02 to +.02. The value of x2 moves only by .0001 -its minimum point is hard to see.\nTo repeat: Minimization is easier with dyldx. The screen shows an order of magnitude improvement, when we trace or zoom on f(x) =0. In calculus, we have been taking the derivative for granted. It is natural to get blask about dyldx =0. We forget how intelligent it is, to work with the slope instead of the function.\nzero slope Question 2 How do you get another order of magnitude improvement?\nat minimum Answer Use the next derivative! With a formula for dfldx, which is dZy/dx2, the Fig. 3.13 convergence is even faster. In two steps the error goes from .O1 to .0001 to .00000001.\nAnother infinite zoom went into the formula for dfldx, and Newton's method takes account of it.

Then 3x2 = 3'.\nDividing by 30 and squaring yields The exact solution is x* = & = 1.73205.. .\nA model like this is a benchmark, to test competing methods. It also displays what we never appreciated-the extreme flatness of the graph. The difference in driving time between entering at x* = & and x = 2 is one second.\nTHE CENTERING TRANSFORM AND ZOOM TRANSFORM For a photograph we do two things-point the right way and stand at the right distance. Then take the picture. Those steps are the same for a graph. First we pick the new center point. The graph is shifted, to move that point from (a,b) to (0,O).\nThen we decide how far the graph should reach. It fits in a rectangle, just like the photograph. Rescaling to x/c and y/d puts the desired section of the curve into the rectangle.\nA good photographer does more (like an artist). The subjects are placed and the camera is focused. For good graphs those are necessary too. But an everyday calculator or computer or camera is built to operate without an artist-just aim and shoot.\nI want to explain how to aim at y = f(x).\nWe are doing exactly what a calculator does, with one big difference. It doesn't change coordinates. We do. When x = 1, y = - 2 moves to the center of the viewing window, the calculator still shows that point as (1, -2). When the centering transform acts on y + 2 = m(x - I), those numbers disappear. This will be confusing unless x and y also change. The new coordinates are X = x - 1 and Y = y + 2. Then the new equation is Y = mX.\nThe main point (for humans) is to make the algebra simpler. The computer has no preference for Y = mX over y - yo = m(x - x,). It accepts 2x2 -4x as easily as x2.\nBut we do prefer Y = mX and y = x2, partly because their graphs go through (0,O).\nEver since zero was invented, mathematicians have liked that number best.\nEXAMPLE 4 The parabola y = 2x2- 4x has its minimum when dyldx = 4x -4 = 0.\nThus x = 1 and y = - 2. Move this bottom point to the center: y = 2x2- 44 is The new parabola Y = 2X2 has its bottom at (0,O). It is the same curve, shifted across and up. The only simpler parabola is y = x2. This final step is the job of the zoom.\nNext comes scaling. We may want more detail (zoom in to see the tangent line).\nWe may want a big picture (zoom out to check asymptotes). We might stretch one axis more than the other, if the picture looks like a pancake or a skyscraper.\n36 A z m m tram@rna scdes the X and Y axes by c and d:\nX = EX and y = HY change Y= F(X) to y = dF(x/c).\nThe new x and y are boldface letten, and the graph is re&.\nOften c = d.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 126, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Apply the chain rule to y = dF(x/c). A square zoom has d/c = 1-lines keep their slope. The second derivative is multiplied by d/c2, which changes the bending. A zoom out divides by small numbers c = d, so the big picture is more, curved.\nCombining the centering and zoom transforms, as we do in practice, gives y in terms of x:\ny =f(x) becomes Y=f(X+a)-b andthen y = d f - + a )-bl.\n[ (:\nFig. 3.14 Change of coordinates by centering and zoom.

The window after zoom is -1<c(x -a) < 1 and -1 <d(y - b) < 1. The point (1, 1) was originally in the corner. The point (c-' + a, d + b) is now in the corner.\nThe numbers a, b, c, d are chosen to produce a simpler function (like y = x2).

It is so natural to go from linear equations to quadratic equations. Straight lines use 1,x, y. Second degree curves include x2, xy, y2. If we go on to x3 and y3, the mathematics gets complicated. We now study equations of second degree, and the curves they produce.\nIt is quite important to see both the equations and the curves. This section connects two great parts of mathematics-analysis of the equation and geometry of the curve.\nTogether they produce \"analytic geometry.\" You already know about functions and graphs.

We speak about \"the point\n(5,2).\" Euclid might not have understood.\nWhere Euclid drew a 45\" line through the origin, Descartes wrote down y = x.\nAnalytic geometry has become central to mathematics-we now look at one part of it.\nFig. 3.15 The cutting plane gets steeper: circle to ellipse to parabola to hyperbola.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 129, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The Greeks discovered that all these curves come from slicing a cone by a plane. The curves are \"conic sections.\" A level cut gives a circle, and a moderate angle produces an ellipse. A steep cut gives the two pieces of a hyperbola (Figure 3.15d). At the borderline, when the slicing angle matches the cone angle, the plane carves out a parabola. It has one branch like an ellipse, but it opens to infinity like a hyperbola.\nThroughout mathematics, parabolas are on the border between ellipses and hyperbolas.\nTo repeat: We can slice through cones or we can look for equations. For a cone of light, we see an ellipse on the wall. (The wall cuts into the light cone.) For an equation AX^ + Bxy + Cy2+Dx + Ey + F = 0, we will work to make it simpler. The graph will be centered and rescaled (and rotated if necessary), aiming for an equation like y = x2. Eccentricity and polar coordinates are left for Chapter 9.\nTHE PARABOLA y = m2+ bx + c You knew this function long before calculus. The graph crosses the x axis when y = 0. The quadratic formula solves y = 3x2- 4x + 1 = 0, and so does factoring into\n(x - 1)(3x- 1). The crossing points x = 1 and x =f come from algebra.\nThe other important point is found by calculus. It is the minimum point, where dyldx = 6x - 4 = 0. The x coordinate is 8 =f , halfway between the crossing points.\nThe height is ymin = -i.This is the vertex V in Figure 3.16a-at the bottom of the parabola.\nA parabola has no asymptotes. The slope 6x - 4 doesn't approach a constant.\nTo center the vertex Shift left by 3 and up by f.

A solar collector and a TV dish are parabolic. They concentrate sun rays and TV signals onto a point-a heat cell or a receiver collects them at the focus. The 1982 UMAP Journal explains how radar and sonar use the same idea. Car headlights turn the idea around, and send the light outward.\nHere is a classical fact about parabolas. From each point on the curve, the distance to the focus equals the distance to the \"directrix.\" The directrix is the line y = -p below the vertex (so the vertex is halfway between focus and directrix). With p = 4, the distance down from any (x, y) is y + 4. Match that with the distance to the focus at (0,a)- this is the square root below. Out comes the special parabola y = x2:\ny + 4 =\n- (square both sides) - y = x2.\n(2) The exercises give practice with all the steps we have taken-center the parabola to Y = ax2, rescale it to y = x2, locate the vertex and focus and directrix.\nSummary for other parabolas y = ax2+ bx + c has its vertex where dy/dx is zero.\nThus 2ax + b = 0 and x = -b/2a. Shifting across to that point is \"completing the square\":\nax2+ bx + e equals a (x + - + C.\n:l)i Here C = c -(b2/4a) is the height of the vertex. The centering transform X = x + (b/2a), Y = y - C produces Y = ax2. It moves the vertex to (0, 0), where it belongs.\nFor the ellipse and hyperbola, our plan of attack is the same:\n1. Center the curve to remove any linear terms Dx and Ey.\n2. Locate each focus and discover the reflection property.\n3. Rotate to remove Bxy if the equation contains it.\nx2 y2 ELLIPSES -+ -= 1 (CIRCLES HAVE a= b ) a2 b2 This equation makes the ellipse symmetric about (0, 0)-the center. Changing x to\n-x or y to -y leaves the same equation. No extra centering or rotation is needed.\nThe equation also shows that x2/a2 and y2/b2 cannot exceed one. (They add to one and can't be negative.) Therefore x2 < a2, and x stays between -a and a. Similarly y stays between b and -b. The ellipse is inside a rectangle.\nBy solving for y we get a function (or two functions!) of x:\nThe graphs are the top half (+) and bottom half (-) of the ellipse. To draw the ellipse, plot them together. They meet when y = 0, at x = a on the far right of Figure 3.17 and at x = -a on the far left. The maximum y = b and minimum y = -b are at the top and bottom of the ellipse, where we bump into the enclosing rectangle.\nA circle is a special case of an ellipse, when a = b. The circle equation x2 + y2 = r2 is the ellipse equation with a = b = r.

Radio signals leave two fixed transmitters at the same time. A ship receives the signals a millisecond apart. Where is the ship?\nAnswer: It is on a hyperbola with foci at the transmitters. Radio signals travel 186 miles in a millisecond, so 186 = 2a. This determines the curve. In Long Range Navigation (LORAN) a third transmitter gives another hyperbola. Then the ship is located exactly.\nQuestion 4 How do hyperbolas differ from parabolas, far from the center?\nAnswer Hyperbolas have asymptotes. Parabolas don't.\nThe hyperbola has a natural rescaling. The appearance of x/b is a signal to change to X. Similarly yla becomes Y.

Then read off a and b.\nTHE GENERAL EQUATION Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0 This equation is of second degree, containing any and all of 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2.\nA plane is cutting through a cone. Is the curve a parabola or ellipse or hyperbola?\nStart with the most important case Ax2 + Bxy + Cy2 = 1.\nI I The equation Ax2 + Bxy + cyZ\n= 1 produces a hyperbola if B~ > 4AC and an ellipse if B2 < 4AC. A parabola has B2 = 4AC.\nI To recognize the curve, we remove Bxy by rotating the plane. This also changes A and C-but the combination B~ - 4AC is not changed (proof omitted). An example is 2xy = 1, with B~ = 4. It rotates to y2 - x2 = 1, with - 4AC = 4. That positive number 4 signals a hyperbola-since A = - 1 and C = 1 have opposite signs.\nAnother example is x2 + y2 = 1. It is a circle (a special ellipse). However we rotate, the equation stays the same. The combination B~ - 4AC = 0 - 4 1 1 is negative, as predicted for ellipses.\nTo rotate by an angle a, change x and y to new variables x' and y':\nx = X' cos a - y' sin a\n= x cos a + y sin a and y = x' sin a + y' cos a y' = - y sin a + x cos a.\n(7) Substituting for x and y changes AX^ + Bxy + cy2 = 1 to A ' x ' ~ + B'xly' + Cryf2 = 1.\nThe formulas for A', B', C' are painful so I go to the key point:\nB' is zero if the rotation angle a has tan 2a = B/(A - C).\nWith B' = 0, the curve is easily recognized from A ' x ' ~ + C'yr2 = 1. It is a hyperbola if A' and C' have opposite signs. Then B ' ~\n- 4A1C' is positive. The original B~ - 4AC was also positive, because this special combination stays constant during rotation.\nAfter the xy term is gone, we deal with x and y-by centering. To find the center, complete squares as in Questions 3 and 6. For total perfection, rescale to one of the model equations y = x2 or x2 + y2 = 1 or y2 - x2 = 1.\nThe remaining question is about F = 0. What is the graph of AX? + Bxy + cy2 = O?\nThe ellipse-hyperbola-parabola have disappeared. But if the Greeks were right, the cone is still cut by a plane. The degenerate case F = 0 occurs when the plane cuts right through the sharp point of the cone.\nA level cut hits only that one point (0,O). The equation shrinks to x2 + y2 = 0, a circle with radius zero. A steep cut gives two lines. The hyperbola becomes y2 -?. x2 = 0, leaving only its asymptotes y = + x. A cut at the exact angle of the cone gives only one line, as in x2 = 0. A single point, two lines, and one line are very extreme cases of an ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola.\nAll these \"conic sections\" come from planes and cones. The beauty of the geometry, which Archimedes saw, is matched by the importance of the equations. Galileo discovered that projectiles go along parabolas (Chapter 12). Kepler discovered that the Earth travels on an ellipse (also Chapter 12). Finally Einstein discovered that light travels on hyperbolas.

When we start at x, = 12, the sequence goes back toward 8:\nEquation for limit: If the iterations x, + , = F(x,) converge to x*, then x* = F(x*).\nTo repeat: 8 is special because it equals 4 8 + 4. The number .7391.. . is special because it equals cos .7391.. . . The graphs of y = x and y = F(x) intersect at x*. To explain why the x's converge (or why they don't) is the job of calculus.\nEXAMPLE 3 xn+, = xi has two fixed points: 0 = 0' and 1 = 12. Here F(x) = x2.\nStarting from x, = 3 the sequence a, A, &, . . . goes quickly to x* = 0. The only approaches to x* = 1 are from x, = 1 (of course) and from x, = - 1. Starting from x, = 2 we get 4, 16, 256, . . . and the sequence diverges to + m.\nEach limit x* has a \"basin of attraction.\" The basin contains all starting points x, that lead to x*.

The outer basin Ixo( > 1 led to + co.I challenge you to find the limits and the basins of attraction (by calculator) for F(x) = x - tan x.\nIn Example 3, x* = 0 is attracting. Points near x* move toward x*. The fixed point x* = 1 is repelling. Points near 1 move away. We now find the rule that decides whether x* is attracting or repelling. The key is the slope dF/dx at x*.\n3J Start from any x, near a fixed point x* = F(x*):\nx* is attracting if IdF/dxf is below 1 at x* x* is repelling if IdFldxl is above 1 at x*.\nFirst I will give a calculus proof. Then comes a picture of convergence, by \"cobwebs.\" Both methods throw light on this crucial test for attraction: IdF/dxl< 1.\nFirst proof: Subtract x* = F(x*) from x,,, = F(x,). The difference x,,, - x* is the same as F(x,) - F(x*). This is AF. The basic idea of calculus is that AF is close to F'Ax:\nx,+ - x* = F(x,) - F(x*) z F1(x*)(xn- x*).\n(1) The \"error\" x, - x* is multiplied by the slope dF/dx. The next error x,+ ,- x* is smaller or larger, based on I F'I < 1 or I F'I > 1 at x*. Every step multiplies approximately by F1(x*). Its size controls the speed of convergence.\nIn Example 1, F(x) is cos x and F1(x) is -sin x. There is attraction to .7391 because lsin x* I < 1. In Example 2, F is fx + 4 and F' is i.There is attraction to 8.\nIn Example 3, F is x2 and F' is 2x. There is superattraction to x* = 0 (where F' = 0).\nThere is repulsion from x* = 1 (where F' = 2).\nI admit one major difficulty. The approximation in equation (1) only holds near x*. If x, is far away, does the sequence still approach x*? When there are several attracting points, which x* do we reach? This section starts with good iterations, which solve the equation x* = F(x*) or f(x) = 0. At the end we discover Newton's method. The next section produces crazy but wonderful iterations, not converging and not blowing up. They lead to \"fractals\" and \"Cantor sets\" and \"chaos.\" The mathematics of iterations is not finished. It may never be finished, but we are converging on the answers. Please choose a function and join in.\nTHE GRAPH OF AN ITERATION: COBWEBS The iteration x,, ,= F(x,) involves two graphs at the same time. One is the graph of y = F(x). The other is the graph of y = x (the 45\" line). The iteration jumps back and forth between these graphs. It is a very convenient way to see the whole process.\nExample 1 was x,,, = cos x,. Figure 3.19 shows the graph of cos x and the \"cobweb.\" Starting at (x,, x,) on the 45\" line, the rule is based on x, = F(x,):\nFrom (x,, x,) go up or down to (x,, x,) on the curve.\nFrom (x,, x,) go across to (x,, x,) on the 45\" line.\nThese steps are repeated forever. From x, go up to the curve at F(x,). That height is x, . Now cross to the 45\" line at (x,, x,). The iterations are aiming for (x*, x*) =\n(.7391, .7391). This is the crossing point of the two graphs y = F(x) and y = x.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 139, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Both graphs are straight lines. The cobweb is onesided, from (0,O) to (0,4) to (4,4) to (4,6) to (6,6). Notice how y changes (vertical line) and then x changes (horizontal line). The slope of F(x) is 4,so the distance to 8 is multiplied by f at every step.\nExample 3 was xn+, = xz. The graph of y = x2 crosses the 45\" line at two fixed points: O2 = 0 and l2 = 1. Figure 3.20a starts the iteration close to 1, but it quickly goes away. This fixed point is repelling because F'(1) = 2. Distance from x* = 1 is doubled (at the start). One path moves down to x* = 0-which is superattractive because F' = 0. The path from x, > 1 diverges to infinity.\nEXAMPLE 4 F(x) has two attracting points x* (a repelling x* is always between).\nFigure 3.20b shows two crossings with slope zero. The iterations and cobwebs converge quickly. In between, the graph of F(x) must cross the 45\" line from below. That requires a slope greater than one.

This makes the problem interesting. If no fixed points are attracting, see Section 3.7 for \"cycles\" and \"chaos.\" THE ITERATION xn+,=X, - c~(x,,) At this point we offer the reader a choice. One possibility is to jump ahead to the next section on \"Newton's Method.\" That method is an iteration to solve f(x) = 0.\nThe function F(x) combines x, and f (x,) and f '(x,) into an optimal formula for x,+ ,.\nWe will see how quickly Newton's method works (when it works). It is the outstanding algorithm to solve equations, and it is totally built on tangent approximations.\nThe other possibility is to understand (through calculus) a whole family of iterations. This family depends on a number c, which is at our disposal. The best choice of c produces Newton's method. I emphasize that iteration is by no means a new and peculiar idea. It is a fundamental technique in scientiJic computing.\nWe start by recognizing that there are many ways to reach f(x*) = 0. (I write x* for the solution.) A good algorithm may switch to Newton as it gets close. The iterations use f (x,) to decide on the next point x,,, :\nNotice how F(x) is constructed from f (x)-they are different! We move f to the right side and multiply by a \"preconditioner\" c. The choice of c (or c,, if it changes from step to step) is absolutely critical. The starting guess xo is also important-but its accuracy is not always under our control.\nSuppose the x, converge to x*. Then the limit of equation (2) is x* = x* - cf (x*).\n(3) That gives f (x*)= 0. If the x,'s have a limit, it solves the right equation. It is a fixed point of F (we can assume cn +c # 0 and f (x,) +f (x*)). There are two key questions, and both of them are answered by the slope Ft(x*):\n1.

Then one iteration gives the exact answer: x, = xo -(l/a)(axo- b)= bla. That is the horizontal line in Figure 3.21a, converging in one step. But look at the other lines.\nThis example did not need calculus. Linear equations never do. The key idea is that close to x* the nonlinear equation f (x) = 0 is nearly linear. We apply the tangent approximation. You are seeing how calculus is used, in a problem that doesn't start by asking for a derivative.\nTHE BEST CHOICE OF c The immediate goal is to study the errors x, - x*. They go quickly to zero, if the multiplier is small. To understand x,,, = x, - cf (x,), subtract the equation x* = x* - cf (x*):\nx,+ ,- x* = x, - x* - c( f (x,) -f (x*)).\n(6) Now calculus enters.

The new error at step n + 1 is approximately the old error multiplied by m = 1 - cA. This corresponds to m = 1 - ca in the linear example. We keep returning to the basic test Iml= I Ff(x*)l< 1:\nThere is only one difficulty: We don't know x*. Therefore we don't know the perfect c. It depends on the slope A =f '(x*) at the unknown solution. However we can come close, by using the slope at x,:\nChoose c, = l / f '(x,). Then x,+ = x, -f (xJ f '(x,) = F(x,).\nThis is Newton's method. The multiplier m = 1 - cA is as near to zero as we can make it.

The first step computes 410 and blows up. Figure 3.22a shows why-the tangent line at zero is horizontal. It will never cross the axis.\nRemark 2 Starting at x, = - 1, Newton converges to -fi instead of + fi That is the other x*. Often it is difficult to predict which x* Newton's method will choose.\nAround every solution is a \"basin of attraction,\" but other parts of the basin may be far away. Numerical experiments are needed, with many starts x,. Finding basins of attraction was one of the problems that led to fractals.\n1 1 EXAMPLE 2 Solve -- a = 0 to find x* = - without dividing by a.\nx a Here f (x)= (llx) - a. Newton uses f '(x) = - 1/x2. Surprisingly, we don't divide:\nDo these iterations converge? I will take a = 2 and aim for x* = f.Subtracting 4from both sides of (7) changes the iteration into the error equation:\nX ~ + ~ = ~ X . - ~ X ~ becomes ~ ~ + , - i = - 2 ( x . - i ) ~ .\n(8) At each step the error is squared. This is terrific if (and only if) you are close to x* = ). Otherwise squaring a large error and multiplying by -2 is not good:\nThe algebra in Problem 18 confirrhs those experiments. There is fast convergence if 0 < xo < 1. There is divergence if x, is negative or xo > 1. The tangent line goes to a negative x, . After that Figure 3.22 shows a long trip backwards.\nIn the previous section we drew F(x). The iteration xn+, = F(xn) converged to the 45\" line, where x* = F(x*). In this section we are drawing f (x). Now x* is the point on the axis where f (x*) = 0.\nTo repeat: It is f(x*) = 0 that we aim for. But it is the slope Ff(x*) that decides whether we get there. Example 2 has F(x) = 2x - 2x2. The fixed points are x* = f\n(our solution) and x* = 0 (not attractive). The slopes F' (x*) are zero (typical Newton) and 2 (typical repeller). The key to Newton's method is Ff= 0 at the solution:\nf '(x)\n\"(x). Then Ff(x) = 0 when f (x)= 0.\nThe slope of F(x)= x -- is (f'w2", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 147, "section_id": "s0005-3pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

In Chapter 13, and in reality, Newton's method solves much harder equations. Here I am going to choose a third example that came from pure curiosity about what might happen. The results are absolutely amazing. The equation is x2 = - 1.\nEXAMPLE 3 What happens to Newton's method ifyou ask it to solve f (x) = x2 + 1 = O?\nThe only solutions are the imaginary numbers x* = i and x* = - i. There is no real square root of -1. Newton's method might as well give up. But it has no way to know that! The tangent line still crosses the axis at a new point x,,, , even if the curve y = x2 + 1 never crosses. Equation (5) still gives the iteration for b = - 1:\nThe x's cannot approach i or -i (nothing is imaginary). So what do they do?\nThe starting guess xo = 1 is interesting. It is followed by x, = 0. Then x2 divides by zero and blows up. I expected other sequences to go to infinity. But the experiments showed something different (and mystifying). When x, is large, x,,, is less than half as large. After x, = 10 comes x,, ,= i(10 -&)= 4.95. After much indecision and a long wait, a number near zero eventually appears. Then the next guess divides by that small number and goes far out again. This reminded me of \"chaos.\" It is tempting to retreat to ordinary examples, where Newton's method is a big success. By trying exercises from the book or equations of your own, you will see that the fast convergence to $ is very typical. The function can be much more complicated than x2 - 4 (in practice it certainly is). The iteration for 2x = cos x was in the previous section, and the error was squared at every step. If Newton's method starts close to x*, its convergence is overwhelming. That has to be the main point of this section: Follow the tangent line.\nInstead of those good functions, may I stay with this strange example x2 + 1 = O?\nIt is not so predictable, and maybe not so important, but somehow it is more interesting. There is no real solution x*, and Newton's method x,,, = +(x, - llx,) bounces around. We will now discover x,.\nA FORMULA FOR x, The key is an exercise from trigonometry books. Most of those problems just give practice with sines and cosines, but this one exactly fits +(x, - llx,):\nIn the left equation, the common denominator is 2 sin 8 cos 8 (which is sin 28). The numerator is cos2 0 - sin2 8 (which is cos 28). Replace cosinelsine by cotangent, and the identity says this:\nIf xo = cot 8 then x, = cot 28.\nThen x2 = cot 48.\nThen x, = cot 2\" 8.\nThis is the formula. Our points are on the cotangent curve. Figure 3.23 starts from xo = 2 = cot 8, and every iteration doubles the angle.\nExample A The sequence xo = 1, x, = 0, x2 = m matches the cotangents of ;n/4,;n/2, and n.

This sequence cycles forever because xo = x2 = x, = . . . .\nExample C Start with a large xo (a small 8). Then x, is about half as large (at 20).\nEventually one of the angles 4 8,8 8, ... hits on a large cotangent, and the x's go far out again. This is typical. Examples A and B were special, when 8/n was or 3.\nWhat we have here is chaos. The x's can't converge. They are strongly repelled by all points. They are also extremely sensitive to the value of 8.After ten steps 0 is multiplied by 2'' = 1024. The starting angles 60\" and 61\" look close, but now they are different by 1024\". If that were a multiple of 18W, the cotangents would still be close. In fact the xlo's are 0.6 and 14.\nThis chaos in mathematics is also seen in nature. The most familiar example is the weather, which is much more delicate than you might think. The headline \"Forecasting Pushed Too Far\" appeared in Science (1989). The article said that the snowballing of small errors destroys the forecast after six days. We can't follow the weather equations for a month-the flight of a plane can change everything. This is a revolutionary idea, that a simple rule can lead to answers that are too sensitive to compute.\nWe are accustomed to complicated formulas (or no formulas). We are not accustomed to innocent-looking formulas like cot 2\" 8, which are absolutely hopeless after 100 steps.\nCHAOS FROM A PARABOLA Now I get to tell you about new mathematics. First I will change the iteration x,+ ,= 4(xn- llx,) into one that is even simpler. By switching from x to z = l/(l + x2), each new z turns out to involve only the old z and z2:\nThis is the most famous quadratic iteration in the world. There are books about it, and Problem 28 shows where it comes from.

The new thing is to locate this quadratic as the last member (when a = 4) of the family Example 2 happened to be the middle member a = 2, converging to ). I would like to give a brief and very optional report on this iteration, for different a's.\n.The general principle is to start with a number zo between 0 and 1, and compute z, ,z2, z3, . .. . It is fascinating to watch the behavior change as a increases. You can see it on your own computer. Here we describe some things to look for. All numbers stay between 0 and 1 and they may approach a limit. That happens when a is small:\nfor 0 < a < 1 the z, approach z* = 0 for 1 < a < 3 the z, approach z* = (a - l)/a Those limit points are the solutions of z = F(z). They are the fixed points where z* = az* - a(z*)'. But remember the test for approaching a limit: The slope at z* cannot be larger than one. Here F = az - az2 has F' = a - 2az. It is easy to check IF'I < 1 at the limits predicted above. The hard problem-sometimes impossibleis to predict what happens above a = 3. Our case is a = 4.\nThe z's cannot approach a limit when IFt(z*)l> 1. Something has to happen, and there are at least three possibilities:\nThe z,'s can cycle or Jill the whole interval (0,l) or approach a Cantor set.\nI start with a random number zo, take 100 steps, and write down steps 101 to 105:\nThe first column is converging to a \"2-cycle.\" It alternates between x = 342 and y = .452. Those satisfy y = F(x) and x = F(y) = F(F(x)). If we look at a double step when a = 3.4, x and y are fixed points of the double iteration z , + ~= F(F(z,)). When a increases past 3.45, this cycle becomes unstable.\nAt that point the period doublesfrom 2 to 4. With a = 3.5 you see a \"4-cycle\" in the table-it repeats after four steps. The sequence bounces from 375 to .383 to 327 to SO1 and back to 375. This cycle must be attractive or we would not see it. But it also becomes unstable as a increases. Next comes an 8-cycle, which is stable in a little window (you could compute it) around a = 3.55. The cycles are stable for shorter and shorter intervals of a's. Those stability windows are reduced by the Feigenbaum shrinking factor 4.6692.. .. Cycles of length 16 and 32 and 64 can be seen in physical experiments, but they are all unstable before a = 3.57. What happens then?\nThe new and unexpected behavior is between 3.57 and 4. Down each line of Figure 3.24, the computer has plotted the values of zlool to z2000-omitting the first thousand points to let a stable period (or chaos) become established.

There may be a stable cycle of some long period.\nThe z's may come close to every point between 0 and 1. A third possibility is to approach a very thin limit set, which looks like the famous Cantor set:\nTo construct the Cantor set, divide [O,l] into three pieces and remove the open interval (4,3). Then remove (&,5) and (&#) from what remains. At each step take out the middle thirds. The points that are left form the Cantor set.\nAll the endpoints 3, f,6, 4, ... are in the set. So is $ (Problem 42). Nevertheless the lengths of the removed intervals add to 1 and the Cantor set has \"measure zero.\" What is especially striking is its self-similarity: Between 0 and you see the same Cantor set three times smaller. From 0 to 6 the Cantor set is there again, scaled down\n.\nby 9. Every section, when blown up, copies the larger picture.\nFractals That self-similarity is typical of a fractal. There is an infinite sequence of scales. A mathematical snowflake starts with a triangle and adds a bump in the middle of each side. At every step the bumps lengthen the sides by 413. The final boundary is self-similar, like an infinitely long coastline.\nThe word \"fractal\" comes from fractional dimension. The snowflake boundary has dimension larger than 1 and smaller than 2. The Cantor set has dimension larger than 0 and smaller than 1. Covering an ordinary line segment with circles of radius r would take clr circles.

The velocity could be 100 and then 50-averaging 75 but never equal to 75. If we allow a jump in velocity, it can jump right over its average. At that moment the velocity does not exist. (The distance function in Figure 3.26a has no derivative at x = 1.) We will take away this cheap escape by requiring a derivative at all points inside the interval.\nIn Figure 3.26b the distance increases by 150 when t increases by 2. There is a derivative df/dt at all interior points (but an infinite slope at t = 0). The average velocity is Af _ f(2) -f(0) 150 75.\nAt 2-0 2 The conclusion of the theorem is that df/dt = 75 at some point inside the interval.\nThere is at least one point where f'(c) = 75.\nThis is not a constructive theorem. The value of c is not known. We don't find c, we just claim (with proof) that such a point exists.\nThe left side is the average slope Af/Ax. It equals df/dx at c. The notation for a closed interval [with endpoints] is [a, b]. For an open interval (without endpoints) we write (a, b). Thus f' is defined in (a, b), and f remains continuous at a and b. A derivative is allowed at those endpoints too-but the theorem doesn't require it.\nThe proof is based on a special case-when f(a) = 0 and f(b) = 0. Suppose the function starts at zero and returns to zero. The average slope or velocity is zero. We have to prove that f'(c)= 0 at a point in between. This special case (keeping the assumptions on f(x)) is called Rolle's theorem.\nGeometrically, if f goes away from zero and comes back, then f' = 0 at the turn.\n3N Rolle's theorem Suppose f(a) =f(b)= 0 (zero at the ends). Then f'(c) =0 at some point with a < c < b.\nProof At a point inside the interval where f(x) reaches its maximum or minimum, df/dx must be zero. That is an acceptable point c. Figure 3.27a shows the difference between f= 0 (assumed at a and b) and f' = 0 (proved at c).\n3M Mean Value Theorem Suppose f(x) is continuous in the closed interval a < x < b and has a derivative everywhere in the open interval a < x < b.

At those endpoints dfldx might not be zero. But in that case the minimum is reached at an interior point c, which is equally acceptable. The key to our proof is that a continuous function on [a, b] reaches its maximum and minimum. This is the Extreme Value Theorem.?\nIt is ironic that Rolle himself did not believe the logic behind calculus. He may not have believed his own theorem! Probably he didn't know what it meant-the language of \"evanescent quantities\" (Newton) and \"infinitesimals\" (Leibniz) was exciting but frustrating. Limits were close but never reached. Curves had infinitely many flat sides. Rolle didn't accept that reasoning, and what was really serious, he didn't accept the conclusions. The Acadkmie des Sciences had to stop his battles (he fought against ordinary mathematicians, not Newton and Leibniz). So he went back to number theory, but his special case when f (a) =f (b) = 0 leads directly to the big one.\n/ slope df/dx - ' Fmax f(c) = 0 Fig. 3.27 Rolle's theorem is when f(a)=f(b) = 0 in the Mean Value Theorem.\nProof of the Mean Value Theorem We are looking for a point where dfldx equals AflAx. The idea is to tilt the graph back to Rolle's special case (when Af was zero).\nIn Figure 3.27b, the distance F(x) between the curve and the dotted secant line comes from subtraction:\nAt a and b, this distance is F(a) = F(b) = 0. Rolle's theorem applies to F(x). There is an interior point where Ff(c) = 0. At that point take the derivative of equation (2):\n0 =f '(c) - (Af /Ax). The desired point c is found, proving the theorem.\nEXAMPLE 1 The function f (x) = 6goes from zero at x = 0 to ten at x = 100. Its average slope is Af/Ax = 10/100. The derivative ff(x) = 1 / 2 6 exists in the open interval (0, loo), even though it blows up at the end x = 0. By the Mean Value Theorem there must be a point where 10/100 =f '(c) = 1/2& That point is c = 25.\nThe truth is that nobody cares about the exact value of c. Its existence is what matters. Notice how it affects the linear approximation f (x)zf (a) + f'(a)(x - a), which was basic to this chapter. Close becomes exact ( z becomes = ) when f' is computed at c instead of a:\n?If f(x) doesn't reach its maximum M, then 1/(M-f (x))would be continuous but also approach infinity.

Three hundred years later we apply his name to other cases permitted in (6), when f'/g' might approach a limit even if the separate parts do not.\nTo prove this more general form of l'H6pital's Rule, we need a more general Mean Value Theorem.

The derivative of sin x times x2 is not cos x times 2x. The product rule gave two terms, not one term. But there is another way of combining the sine function f and the squaring function g into a single function. The derivative of that new function does involve the cosine times 2x (but with a certain twist). We will first explain the new function, and then find the \"chain rule\" for its derivative.\nMay I say here that the chain rule is important. It is easy to learn, and you will use it often. I see it as the third basic way to find derivatives of new functions from derivatives of old functions. (So far the old functions are xn, sin x, and cos x. Still ahead are ex and log x.) When f and g are added and multiplied, derivatives come from the sum rule and product rule. This section combines f and g in a third way.\nThe new function is sin(x2)-the sine of x2. It is created out of the two original functions: if x = 3 then x2 = 9 and sin(x2) = sin 9. There is a \"chain\" of functions, combining sin x and x2 into the composite function sin(x2). You start with x, then find g(x), then Jindf (g(x)):\nThe squaring function gives y = x2. This is g(x).\nThe sine function produces z = sin y = sin(x2). This is f(g(x)).\nThe \"inside function\" g(x) gives y. This is the input to the \"outside function\" f(y). That is called composition. It starts with x and ends with z. The composite function is sometimes written fog (the circle shows the difference from an ordinary product fg).\nMore often you will see f(g(x)):\nOther examples are cos 2x and ( 2 ~ ) ~ , with g = 2x. On a calculator you input x, then push the \"g\" button, then push the \"f\" button:\nFrom x compute y =g(x) From y compute z =f(y).\nThere is not a button for every function! But the squaring function and sine function are on most calculators, and they are used in that order.

As x changes, these y's will change-to keep (x, y) on the curve. We want to know dy/dx at a typical point. For xy = 2 that is no trouble, but the slope of y5+ xy = 3 requires a new idea.\nIn the first case, solve for y = 2/x and take its derivative: dy/dx = - 2/x2.The curve is a hyperbola. At x = 2 the slope is -214 = -112.\nThe problem with y5+ xy = 3 is that it can't be solved for y. Galois proved that there is no solution formula for fifth-degree equations.? The function y(x) cannot be given explicitly. All we have is the implicit definition of y, as a solution to y5 + xy = 3. The point x = 2, y = 1 satisfies the equation and lies on the curve, but how to find dyldx?\nThis section answers that question. It is a situation that often occurs. Equations like sin y + sin x = 1 or y sin y = x (maybe even sin y = x) are difficult or impossible to solve directly for y. Nevertheless we can find dyldx at any point.\nThe way out is implicit differentiation. Work with the equation as it stands. Find the x derivative of every term in y5 + xy = 3. That includes the constant term 3, whose derivative is zero.\nEXAMPLE I The power rule for y5 and the product rule for xy yield Now substitute the typical point x = 2 and y = 1, and solve for dyldx:\ndy dy dy 5 - + 2 - + 1 = 0 produces - = - - 1 dx dx dx 7' This is implicit differentiation (ID), and you see the idea: Include dyldx from the chain rule, even if y is not known explicitly as a function of x.\ndy EXAMPLE 2 sin y + sin x = 1 leads to cos y -+ cos x = 0 dx dy EXAMPLE 3 y sin y = x leads to y cos y -+ sin y-dy = 1 dx dx Knowing the slope makes it easier to draw the curve.

The slope dy/dx is - y/x.\nThat agrees with the explicit slope - 2/x 2.\nID is explained better by examples than theory (maybe everything is).

They seem to fit here-as applications of the chain rule. The problem is to compute df/dt, but the odd thing is that we are given another derivative dg/dt. To find df/dt, we need a relation between f and g.\nThe chain rule is df/dt = (df/dg)(dg/dt). Here the variable is t because that is typical in applications. From the rate of change of g we find the rate of change off. This is the problem of related rates, and examples will make the point.\nEXAMPLE 5 The radius of a circle is growing by dr/dt = 7.

Their derivatives obey a fundamental rule: dyldx times dxldy equals 1. In Example 2, dyldx is 519 and dxldy is 915.\nThere is another important point. When f and g are applied in the opposite order, they still come back to the start. First f adds 2, then g subtracts 2. The chain g( f(y)) =\n(y + 2) - 2 brings back y. Iffis the inverse of g then g is the inverse off. The relation is completely symmetric, and so is the definition:\nInverse function: If y = g(x) then x = g- '(y). Ifx =g- '(y) then y =g(x).\nThe loop in the figure goes from x to y to x. The composition g- '(g(x)) is the \"identity function.\" Instead of a new point z it returns to the original x. This will make the chain rule particularly easy-leading to (dy/dx)(dx/dy) = 1.\nEXAMPLE 3 y =g(x) = fi and x =f(y) = y2 are inverse functions.\nStarting from x = 9 we find y = 3. The inverse gives 32 = 9. The square of fi is f(g(x)) = x. In the opposite direction, the square root of y2 is g(f(y)) = y.\nCaution That example does not allow x to be negative. The domain of g-the set of numbers with square roots-is restricted to x 2 0. This matches the range of g- '.\nThe outputs y2 are nonnegative. With domain of g = range of g-', the equation x =\n(&)2 is possible and true. The nonnegative x goes into g and comes out of g-'.\nIn this example y is also nonnegative. You might think we could square anything, but y must come back as the square root of y2. So y 2 0.\nTo summarize: The domain of a function matches the range of its inverse.

For each y, the equation g(x) = y is only allowed to produce one x.

This rule holds for all inverse functions, even if their slopes are not constant. It is a crucial application of the chain rule to the derivative of f(g(x)) = x.\nThis is the chain rule with a special feature. Since f(g(x)) = x, the derivative of both sides is 1.

To change the slope from 3 to f , you would have to turn the figure. After that turn there is another problem-the axes don't point to the right and up. You also have to look in a mirror!\n(The typesetter refused to print the letters backward. He thinks it's crazy but it's not .) To keep the book in position, and the typesetter in position, we need a better idea.\nThe graph of x = i y comes from turning the picture across the 45\" line. The y axis becomes horizontal and x goes upward. The point (2,6) on the line y = 3x goes into the point (6,2) on the line x = fy. The eyes see a reflection across the 45\" line\n(Figure 4.6~).

Both examples involve the exponential and the logarithm. One is made up of linear pieces that imitate 2\"; it appeared in Chapter 1. The other is the true function 2\", which is not yet defined-and it' is not going to be defined here. The functions bx and logby are so overwhelmingly important that they deserve and will get a whole chapter of the book (at least). But you have to see the graphs.\nThe slopes in the linear model are powers of 2. So are the heights y at the start of each piece. The slopes 1,2,4, .. . equal the heights 1, 2,4, .. . at those special points.\nThe inverse is a discrete model for the logarithm (to base 2). The logarithm of 1 is 0,because 2' = 1. The logarithm of 2 is 1, because 2' = 2. The logarithm of 2j is the exponent j. Thus the model gives the correct x = log2y at the breakpoints y = 1,2,4, 8, .... The slopes are I,:,\n$, 4, ... because dxldy = l/(dy/dx).\nTI have seen graphs with y=g(x) and also y=g-'(x).\nFor me that is wrong: it has to be x =g-'(y).

The exact slope is a number c (near .7) that we are not yet prepared to reveal.\nThe special property of y = 2\" is that the slope at all points is cy. The slope is proportional to the function. The exponential solves dyldx = cy.\nNow look at the inverse function-the logarithm. Its graph is the mirror image:\nIf y = ZX then x = log,y. If 2'/1° 1.07 then log, 1 .O7 1/10.\nWhat the exponential does, the logarithm undoes-and vice versa. The logarithm of 2\" is the exponent x. Since the exponential starts with slope c, the logarithm must start with slope l/c. Check that numerically. The logarithm of 1.07 is near 1/10. The slope is near .10/.07.

The inverse functions x = sin- 'y and x = tan-'y can be done quickly.

The problem is to invert a chain using the inverse of each piece. The answer is one of the fundamental rules of mathematics:\n40 The inverse of z = h(g(x))is a chain of inverses in the opposite order:\nx =g-l(h-f(z)).\n(3) h-' is applied first because h was applied last: g-'(h- (h(g(x))))=x.\nThat last equation looks like a mess, but it holds the key. In the middle you see h- ' and h. That part of the chain does nothing! The inverse functions cancel, to leave g-'(g(x)). But that is x. The whole chain collapses, when g-' and h-' are in the correct order-which is opposite to the order of h(g(x)).\nEXAMPLE 7 z = h(g(x))= 3(x- 2) and x = g - ' ( h - ' ( z ) ) = i z + 2.\nFirst h- ' divides by 3. Then g - ' adds 2. The inverse of h 0 g is g- 'o h-'. It can be found directly by solving z = 3(x - 2). A chain of inverses is like writing in prose-we do it without knowing it.\nEXAMPLE 8 Invert z = J x - 2 by writing z2 = x - 2 and then x = z2 + 2.\nThe inverse adds 2 and takes the square-but not in that order. That would give\n(z+ 2)2,which is wrong. The correct order is z2 + 2.\nThe domains and ranges are explained by Figure 4.8. We start with x 2 2.\nSubtracting 2 gives y 2 0. Taking the square root gives z 3 0. Taking the square brings back y 3 0. Adding 2 brings back x 3 2-which is in the original domain of g.\nFig. 4.8 The chain g - '(hK1(h(g(x))))\n= x is one-to-one at every step.\nEXAMPLE 9 Inverse matrices (AB)-' = B-'A-'\n(this linear algebra is optional).\nSuppose a vector x is multiplied by a square matrix B: y = g(x)= Bx. The inverse function multiplies by the inverse matrix: x = g - ' ( y ) = B- ' y . It is like multiplication by B = 3 and B- ' = 113, except that x and y are vectors.\nNow suppose a second function multiplies by another matrix A: z = h(g(x))= ABx.\nThe problem is to recover x from z. The first step is to invert A, because that came last: Bx = A-'z. Then the second step multiplies by B-' and brings back x = B - ' A - ' z . The product B- 'A - ' inverts the product AB. The rule for matrix inverses is like the rule for function inverses-in fact it is a special case.\nI had better not wander too far from calculus.

We only want one piece of that curve, in Figure 4.9.\nFor the bold line the domain is restricted. The angle x lies between -7r/2and + n/2.\nOn that interval the sine is increasing, so each y comesfvom exactly one angle x.

We explain how it is done in principle, and then how it is done in practice.\nIntegration is a problem of adding up infinitely many things, each of which is infinitesimally small. Doing the addition is not recommended. The whole point of calculus is to offer a better way.\nThe problem of integration is to find a limit of sums. The key is to work backward from a limit of differences (which is the derivative). We can integrate v(x) ifit turns up as the derivative of another function f(x). The integral of v = cos x is f = sin x. The integral of v = x is f = $x2. Basically, f(x) is an \"antiderivative\". The list of j's will grow much longer (Section 5.4 is crucial). A selection is inside the cover of this book.\nIf we don't find a suitable f(x), numerical integration can still give an excellent answer.\nI could go directly to the formulas for integrals, which allow you to compute areas under the most amazing curves. (Area is the clearest example of adding up infinitely many infinitely thin rectangles, so it always comes first. It is certainly not the only problem that integral calculus can solve.) But I am really unwilling just to write down formulas, and skip over all the ideas. Newton and Leibniz had an absolutely brilliant intuition, and there is no reason why we can't share it.\nThey started with something simple. We will do the same.\nSUMS A N D DIFFERENCES Integrals and derivatives can be mostly explained by working (very briefly) with sums and differences. Instead of functions, we have n ordinary numbers. The key idea is nothing more than a basic fact of algebra. In the limit as n + co,it becomes the basic fact of calculus. The step of \"going to the limit\" is the essential difference between algebra and calculus! It has to be taken, in order to add up infinitely many infinitesimals-but we start out this side of it.\nTo see what happens before the limiting step, we need two sets of n numbers. The first set will be v,, v,, ..., v,, where suggests velocity. The second set of numbers will be f,,f,, . . . ,f,, where f recalls the idea of distance. You might think d would be a better symbol for distance, but that is needed for the dx and dy of calculus.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 187, "section_id": "s0007-5pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

When you are given 1, 3, 6, 10, how do you produce 1, 2, 3, 4? By taking drerences. The difference between 10 and 6 is 4. Subtracting 6 - 3 is 3. The difference f2 -fl = 3 - 1 is v2 = 2.\nEach v is the difference between two f 's:\nvj is the dierencefi\n.\nThis is the discrete form of the derivative. I admit to a small difficulty at j = 1, from the fact that there is no fo. The first v should be fl -fo, and the natural idea is to agree that fo is zero. This need for a starting point will come back to haunt us (or help us) in calculus.\nNow look again at those same numbers-but start with v. From v = 1,2,3,4 how do you produce f = 1,3,6, lo? By taking sums. The first two v's add to 3, which is f2.\nThe first three v's add to f3 = 6. The sum of all four v's is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Taking sums is the opposite of taking di$erences.\nThat idea from algebra is the key to calculus. The sum& involves all the numbers v, + v2 + + vj. The difference vj involves only the two numbers fi - f i - . The fact that one reverses the other is the \"Fundamental Theorem.\" Calculus will change sums to integrals and differences to derivatives-but why not let the key idea come through now?\nThe differences of the f's add up to f,-fo . All f's in between are canceled, leaving only the last fn and the starting foe The sum \"telescopes\":\n01 + U2 + 03 + ... + vn = (fl -fo) + (f2 -f1) + (f3 -f2) + ... + (fn -fn- 1)- The number fl is canceled by -fl. Similarly -f2 cancels f2 and -f, cancels f3.\nEventuallyfn and -fo are left. When fo is zero, the sum is the finalf,.\nThat completes the algebra. We add the v's by finding the f 's.\nQuestion How do you add the odd numbers 1 + 3 + 5 + -..+ 99 (the v's)?\nAnswer They are the differences between 0, 1,4,9, . . . . These f's are squares. By the Fundamental Theorem, the sum of 50 odd numbers is (50)2.\nThe tricky part is to discover the right f's! Their differences must produce the v's.\nIn calculus, the tricky part is to find the right f(x). Its derivative must produce v(x).\nIt is remarkable how often f can be found-more often for integrals than for sums.\nOur next step is to understand how the integral is a limit of sums.\nSUMS APPROACH INTEGRALS Suppose you start a successful company.

The income in three months was not more than 112 times 114, the\n. rate multiplied by the time.\nAll other quarters and years were also overstated. Figure 5.2a is closer to reality, with 4 years divided into 16 quarters. It gives a new estimate for total income.\nAgain there are two ways to find the total. We add a+\n+ + ,/16/4, remembering to multiply them all by 114 (because each rate applies to 114 year).\nThis is also the area of the 16 rectangles. The area approach is better because the 114 is automatic. Each rectangle has base 114, so that factor enters each area. The total area is now 5.56 million dollars, closer to the truth.\nYou see what is coming. The next step divides time into weeks. After one week the rate fi is only J1/52. That is the height of the first rectangle-its base is Ax = 1/52. There is a rectangle for every week. Then a hard-working investor divides time into days, and the base of each rectangle is Ax = 11365.

It is a stretched-out S, from the Latin word for sum. This symbol is a powerful reminder of the whole construction: Sum approaches integral, S approaches I, and rectangular area approaches curved area:\ncurved area = l v(x) dx = 5 fi dx.\n(1) The rectangles of base Ax lead to this limit-the integral of &.The \"dx\" indicates that Ax approaches zero. The heights vj of the rectangles are the heights v(x) of the curve. The sum of vj times Ax approaches \"the integral of v of x dx.\" You can imagine an infinitely thin rectangle above every point, instead of ordinary rectangles above special points.\nWe now find the area under the square root curve. The \"limits of integration\" are 0 and 4. The lower limit is x = 0, where the area begins. (The start could be any point x = a.) The upper limit is x = 4, since we stop after four years. (The Jinish could be any point x = b.) The area of the rectangles is a sum of base Ax times heights &.\nThe curved area is the limit of this sum. That l i d is the integral of &porn 0 to 4:\nThe outstanding problem of integral calculus is still to be solved. What is this limiting area? We have a symbol for the answer, involving I and & and dx-but we don't have a number.\nTHE ANTIDERIVATIVE I wish I knew who discovered the area under the graph of &.It may have been Newton. The answer was available earlier, but the key idea was shared by Newton and Leibniz. They understood the parallels between sums and integrals, and between differences and derivatives. I can give the answer, by following that analogy. I can't give the proof (yet)-it is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nIn algebra the differencef;. -f;.-, is vj. When we add, the sum of the v's isf. -fo.\nIn calculus the derivative of f(x) is v(x). When we integrate, the area under the v(x) curve is f(x) minus f(0).

The derivative of xn is nxn-'-now we need the antiderivative. The quick formula is f(x) = xn+'/(n+ 1)-we aim to understand it.\nSolution Since the derivative lowers the exponent, the antiderivative raises it. We go from x'I2 to x3I2. But then the derivative is (3/2)x1I2. It contains an unwanted factor 312. To cancel that factor, put 213 into the antiderivative:\nf(x) = 3x3I2has the required derivative V(X)= x'I2 = &.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 192, "section_id": "s0007-5pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

But if you allow calculus to repeat that answer, and build up the integral f(x) = +x2 as the limiting area of many rectangles, you will have the beginning of something important.\nThe four rectangles have area 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. That is greater than 8, because the triangle is inside. 10 is a first approximation to the triangular area 8, and to improve it we need more rectangles.\nThe next rectangles will be thinner, of width Ax = 112 instead of the original Ax = 1. There will be eight rectangles instead of four. They extend above the line, so the answer is still too high. The new heights are 112, 1, 312, 2, 512, 3, 712, 4.

(The next answer would be 84.) But more important than the formula is the idea. We are carrying out a Iimiting process, one step at a time. The area of the rectangles is approaching the area of the triangle, as Ax decreases. The same limiting process will apply to other areas, in which the region is much more complicated. Therefore we pause to comment on what is important.\nArea Under a Curve What requirements are imposed on those thinner and thinner rectangles? It is not essential that they all have the same width. And it is not required that they cover the triangle completely. The rectangles could lie below the curve. The limiting answer will still be 8, even if the widths Ax are unequal and the rectangles fit inside the triangle or across it. We only impose two rules:\n1. The largest width Ax,,, must approach zero.\n2. The top of each rectangle must touch or cross the curve.\nThe area under the graph is defined to be the limit of these rectangular areas, if that limit exists. For the straight line, the limit does exist and equals 8. That limit is independent of the particular widths and heights-as we absolutely insist it should be.\nSection 5.5 allows any continuous v(x). The question will be the same-Does the limit exist? The answer will be the same- Yes. That limit will be the integral of v(x), and it will be the area under the curve.

The next section searches for antiderivatives.\nTHE SIGMA NOTATION In a section about sums, there has to be a decent way to express them. Consider l 2 + 2' + 32+ 42.The individual terms are vj =j2. Their sum can be written in summation notation, using the capital Greek letter C (pronounced sigma):\n4 1' + 2' + 32+ 42 is written x j2.\nj=1 Spoken aloud, that becomes \"the sum of j 2 from j = 1 to 4.\" It equals 30. The limits on j (written below and above C) indicate where to start and stop:\nThe k at the end of ( 1 ) makes an additional point. There is nothing special about the letter j. That is a \"dummy variable,\" no better and no worse than k (or i). Dummy variables are only on one side (the side with C),and they have no effect on the sum.\nThe upper limit n is on both sides. Here are six sums:\n1 1 1\n'f 7= I + - + - + ... = 2 [infinite series] k = O 2 2 4 The numbers 1 and n or 1 and 4 (or 0 and K ) are the lower limit and upper limit.\nThe dummy variable i or j or k is the index of summation. I hope it seems reasonable that the infinite series 1 + 3+ $ + adds to 2. We will come back to it in Chapter 10.t A sum like Z:=, 6 looks meaningless, but it is actually 6 + 6 + ... + 6 = 6n.\nIt follows the rules. In fact C:=, j 2 is not meaningless either. Every term is j 2 and by the same rules. that sum is 4j2. However the i was probably intended to be j.\nThen the sum is 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.\nQuestion What happens to these sums when the upper limits are changed to n?\nAnswer The sum depends on the stopping point n. A formula is required (when possible). Integrals stop at .u, sums stop at n, and we now look for special cases when\n.f(.u) or *f,can be found.\nA SPECIAL SUMMATION FORMULA How do you add the first 100 whole numbers?

(He solved this problem at a ridiculous age, which gave his friends the idea of getting him into another class.) His solution was to combine 1 + 100, and 2 + 99, and 3 + 98, always adding to 101. There are fifty of those combinations. Thus the sum is (50)(101) = 5050.\nThe sum from 1 to n uses the same idea. The first and last terms add to n + 1. The next terms n - 1 and 2 also add to n + 1. If n is even (as 100 was) then there are i n parts. Therefore the sum is i n times n + 1:\nThe important term is in2, but the exact sum is i n 2 + in.\nWhat happens if n is an odd number (like n = 99)? Formula (2) remains true. The combinations 1 + 99 and 2 + 98 still add to n + 1 = 100. There are 399) = 493 such pairs, because the middle term (which is 50) has nothing to combine with. Thus 1 + 2 + + 99 equals 493 times 100, or 4950.\nRemark That sum had to be 4950, because it is 5050 minus 100. The sum up to 99 equals the sum up to 100 with the last term removed. Our key formula fn -fn= v, has turned up again!\nEXAMPLE Find the sum 101 + 102+ ... + 200 of the second hundred numbers.\nFirst solution This is the sum from 1 to 200 minus the sum from 1 to 100:\nThe middle sum is $(200)(201) and the last is i(100)(101). Their difference is 15050.\nNote! I left out '7 = \"in the limits. It is there, but not written.\nSecond solution The answer 15050 is exactly the sum of the first hundred numbers\n(which was 5050) plus an additional 10000. Believing that a number like 10000 can never turn up by accident, we look for a reason. It is found through changing the limits of summation:\n200 j is the same sum as\n(k + 100).\nj= 101 k = l This is important, to be able to shift limits around. Often the lower limit is moved to zero or one, for convenience. Both sums have 100 terms (that doesn't change). The dummy variable j is replaced by another dummy variable k. They are related by j = k + 100 or equivalently by k =j - 100.\nThe variable must change everywhere-in the lower limit and the upper limit as well as inside the sum. If j starts at 101, then k =j - 100 starts at 1. If j ends at 200, k ends at 100. If j appears in the sum, it is replaced by k + 100 (and if j2 appeared it would become (k + From equation (4) you see why the answer is 15050. The sum 1 + 2 + ... + 100 is 5050 as before. 100 is added to each of those 100 terms. That gives 10000.\nEXAMPLES OF CHANGING THE VARIABLE (and the limits) 3 4 1 2' equals 1 2 ' '\n(here i =j - 1).

So j + 3 = n and j = n - 3.\nA final step is possible, and you will often see it. The new variable j can be changed back to i. Dummy variables have no meaning of their own, but at first the result looks surprising:\n5 6 C 2' equals 2 2'- ' equals 2 zi- '.\ni = 0 j= 1 i= 1 With practice you might do that in one step, skipping the temporary letter j. Every i on the left becomes i - 1 on the right. Then i = 0, . . . , 5 changes to i = 1, . . . ,6. (At first two steps are safer.) This may seem a minor point, but soon we will be changing the limits on integrals instead of sums. Integration is parallel to summation, and it is better to see a \"change of variable\" here first.\nNote about 1 + 2 + .-. + n. The good thing is that Gauss found the sum f n(n + 1).\nThe bad thing is that his method looked too much like a trick. I would like to show how this fits the fundamental rule connecting sums and differences:\nGauss says thatf, is f n(n + 1). Reducing n by 1, his formula for&-, is f (n - 1)n. The dference f, - f,-, should be the last term n in the sum:\nThis is the one term v, = n that is included inf, but not inf,-I .\nThere is a deeper point here. For any sum f,, there are two things to check. The f's must begin correctly and they must change correctly. The underlying idea is mathematical induction: Assume the statement is true below n. Prove it for n.\nGoat To prove that 1 + 2 + --. + n = f n(n + 1). This is the guess f,.\nProof by induction: Check fl (it equals 1). Check f, -f, - (it equals n).\nFor n = 1 the answer fn(n + 1) = f 1 2 is correct. For n = 2 this formula f 2 3 agrees with 1 + 2. But that separate test is not necessary! Iffl is right, and i f the changef, -f,-, is right for every n, thenf, must be right. Equation (6) was the key test, to show that the change in f's agrees with v.\nThat is the logic behind mathematical induction, but I am not happy with most of the exercises that use it. There is absolutely no excitement. The answer is given by some higher power (like Gauss), and it is proved correct by some lower power (like us). It is much better when we lower powers find the answer for ourse1ves.t Therefore I will try to do that for the second problem, which is the sum of squares.\nTHE SUM OF j2 AND THE INTEGRAL OF x2 An important calculation comes next. It is the area in Figure 5.6. One region is made up of rectangles, so its area is a sum of n pieces. The other region lies under the parabola v = x2. It cannot be divided into rectangles, and calculus is needed.\nThe first problem is to find f, = 1' + 22 + 32 + + n2. This is a sum of squares, with fl = 1 and f2 = 5 and f, = 14. The goal is to find the pattern in that sequence.\nBy trying to guessf, we are copying what will soon be done for integrals.\nCalculus looks for an f(x) whose derivative is v(x).

Algebra looks for f,'s whose differences produce v,. Here f, could be called an antidiflerence (better to call it a sum).\nThe best start is a good guess. Copying directly from integrals, we might try fn =fn3. To test if it is right, check whether f,-fn-I produces on = n2:\nWe see n2, but also -n + f. The guess fn3 needs correction terms. To cancel f in the difference, I subtract f n from the sum. To put back n in the difference, I add 1 + 2 + .-.+ n =qn(n + 1) to the sum. The new guess (which should be right) is To check this answer, verify first that fl = 1. Also f2 = 5 and f3 = 14. To be certain, verify that fn -f,-, = n2. For calculus the important term is in3:\nn 1 1 1 The sum j2 of the first n squares is - n3 plus corrections - n2 and - n.\nj = 1 3 2 6 In practice fn3 is an excellent estimate. The sum of the first 100 squares is approximately f(100)3, or a third of a million. If we need the exact answer, equation (7) is available: the sum is 338,350. Many applications (example: the number of steps to solve 100 linear equations) can settle for in3.\nWhat is fascinating is the contrast with calculus. Calculus has no correction terms!\nThey get washed away in the limit of thin rectangles. When the sum is replaced by the integral (the area), we get an absolutely clean answer:\nThe integral of v = x2from x = 0 to x = n is exactly in3.\nThe area under the parabola, out to the point x = 100, is precisely a third of a million.\nWe have to explain why, with many rectangles.\nThe idea is to approach an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. A hundred rectangles gave an area of 338,350. Now take a thousand rectangles. Their heights are (&)2, (&)2, ... because the curve is v = x2.

They contain Ax, and as the rectangles get thinner they disappear. They only account for the small corners of rectangles that lie above the curve. The vanishing of those corners will eventually be proved for any continuous functions-the area from the correction terms goes to zero-but here in equation (9) you see it explicitly.\nThe area under the curve came from the central idea of integration: 100/Ax rectangles of width Ax approach the limiting area = f The rectangular area is Z vj Ax.\nThe exact area is j V(X)dx. In the limit Z becomes j and vj becomes v(x) and AX becomes dx.\nThat completes the calculation for a parabola. It used the formula for a sum of squares, which was special.

The limit of the sums agrees with the antiderivative: The antiderivative of v(x) = x2 isf(x) = ix3.\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem, the area under v(x) is f(x):\nThat Fundamental Theorem is not yet proved! I mean it is not proved by us. Whether Leibniz or Newton managed to prove it, I am not quite sure.

With eight rectangles and Ax = f, the area was 8 + 2Ax = 9. Sixteen rectangles of width i brought the correction 2Ax down to f . The exact area is 8. The error is proportional to Ax.\nImportant note There you see a question in applied mathematics. If there is an error, what size is it? How does it behave as Ax + O? The Ax term disappears in the limit, and AX)^ disappears faster. But to get an error of we need eight million rectangles:\n2A x = 2 4/8,000,000 = 10 - 6.\nThat is horrifying! The numbers 10,9, 83, 8i, . . . seem to approach the area 8 in a satisfactory way, but the convergence is much too slow. It takes twice as much work to get one more binary digit in the answer-which is absolutely unacceptable. Somehow the Ax term must be removed. If the correction is AX)^ instead of Ax, then a thousand rectangles will reach an accuracy of The problem is that the rectangles are unbalanced. Their right sides touch the graph of v, but their left sides are much too high. The best is to cross the graph in the middle of the interval-this is the midpoint rule. Then the rectangle sits halfway across the line v = x, and the error is zero. Section 5.8 comes back to this rule-and to Simpson's rule that fits parabolas and removes the S AX)^ term and is built into many calculators.\nFinally we try the quick way.

The three basic methods of differential calculus also dominate integral calculus:\nlinearity of derivatives -,linearity of integrals product rule for derivatives -+ integration by parts chain rule for derivatives -+ integrals by substitution The easiest is linearity, which comes first. Integration by parts will be left for Section 7.1. This section starts on substitutions, reversing the chain rule to make an integral simpler.\nLINEARITY OF INTEGRALS What is the integral of v(x) + w(x)? Add the two separate integrals. The graph of t. + w has two regions below it, the area under v and the area from v to v + w.\nAdding areas gives the sum rule. Suppose f and g are antiderivatives of v and w:\nsum rule:\nf + g is an antiderivative of v + w constant rule:\ncf is an antiderivative of cv linearity :\naf + bg is an antiderivative of av + bw This is a case of overkill. The first two rules are special cases of the third, so logically the last rule is enough. However it is so important to deal quickly with constantsjust \"factor them outv-that the rule cv-cf is stated separately. The proofs come from the linearity of derivatives: (af + bg)' equals af' + bg' which equals av + bw.\nThe rules can be restated with integral signs:\n+ w(x)]dx = J V ( X ) dx + J W ( X ) dx sum rule:\nJ [ ~ ( x ) constant rule:\nJ C V ( X ) dx = c J V ( X ) dx linearity:\n~ [ a v ( x ) + b w ( x ) ] d x = a ~ t . ( x ) d x + b ~ w ( x ) d x Note about the constant in f ( x ) + C. All antiderivatives allow the addition of a constant. For a combination like av(x)+ bw(x),the antiderivative is af ( x ) + bg(x)+ C.\nThe constants for each part combine into a single constant. To give all possible antiderivatives of a function, just remember to write \"+ C\" after one of them. The real problem is to find that one antiderivative.\nEXAMPLE 1 The antiderivative of v = x2 + x - is f = x3/3+ ( x -')I(-1) + C.\nEXAMPLE 2 The antiderivative of 6 cos t + 7 sin t is 6 sin t - 7 cos t + C.\n1 1 - sin x - 1 - sin x EXAMPLE 3 Rewrite 1 + sin x as 1 - sin2x -\n= sec2x - sec x tan x.\ncos2x The antiderivative is tan x - sec x + C.

This section takes two steps. First, we choose C. Second, we construct f(x). The object is to define the integral-in the most frequent case when a suitable f(x) is not directly known.\nThe indefinite integral contains \"+ C.\" The constant is not settled because f (x) + C has the same slope for every C. When we care only about the derivative, C makes no difference. When the goal is a number-a definite integral-C can be assigned a definite value at the starting point.\nFor mileage traveled, we subtract the reading at the start. This section does the same for area. Distance is f(t) and area is f(x)-while the definite integral is f (b) -f (a). Don't pay attention to t or x, pay attention to the great formula of integral calculus:\n~ ( t ) lab dt = IabV(X)d~ =f (b) -f (a).\nViewpoint 1: When f is known, the equation gives the area from a to b.\nViewpoint 2: When f is not known, the equation defines f from the area.\nFor a typical v(x), we can't find f (x) by guessing or substitution. But still v(x) has an\n\"area\" under its graph-and this yields the desired integral f (x).\nMost of this section is theoretical, leading to the definition of the integral. You may think we should have defined integrals before computing them-which is logically true. But the idea of area (and the use of rectangles) was already pretty clear in our first examples. Now we go much further. Every continuous function v(x) has an integral (also some discontinuous functions). Then the Fundamental Theorem completes the circle: The integral leads back to dfldx = u(x). The area up to x is the antiderivative that we couldn't otherwise discover.\nTHE CONSTANT OF INTEGRATION Our goal is to turn f (x) + C into a definite integral- the area between a and b. The first requirement is to have area = zero at the start:\nf (a) + C = starting area = 0 so C = -f (a).\n(2) For the area up to x (moving endpoint, indefinite integral), use t as the dummy variable:\n-f (a) (indefinite integral) the a m afro a to b is v(x) dx =f (b)-f (a) (definite integral) EXAMPLE I The area under the graph of 5(x + 1)4 from a to b has f(x) = (x + 1)':\nThe calculation has two separate steps-first find f(x), then substitute b and a.

Every continuous v(x)has an f (x).Whether f (x) has an algebraic formula or not, we can write it as J v(x) dx. To define that integral, we now take the limit of rectangular areas.\nINTEGRALS AS LIMITS OF \"RIEMANN SUMS\" We have come to the definition of the integral. The chapter started with the integrals of x and x2,from formulas for 1 + ..-+ n and l 2+ ..-+ n2.We will not go back to those formulas. But for other functions, too irregular to find exact sums, the rectangular areas also approach a limit.\nThat limit is the integral.

As new points are added, s goes up and S comes down.\nSo the sums come closer together:\ns < s'\n< IS' < S.\n(7) I have left space in between for the curved area-the integral of v(x).\nNow add more and more meshpoints in such a way that Axmax -+ 0.

Calculus is built on limits, and we always add \"if the limit exists.\" That is the delicate point. I hope the next five remarks (increasingly technical) will help to distinguish functions that are Riemann integrable from functions that are not.\nRemark 1 The sums s and S may fail to approach the same limit.

Therefore mk = 0 and Mk = 1. The lower sum is always s = 0. The upper sum is always S = b - a (the sum of 1's times Ax's). The gap in equation (7) stays open. This function V(x) is not Riemann integrable. The area under its graph is not defined (at least by Riemann-see Remark 5).\nRemark 2 The step function U(x) is discontinuous but still integrable. On every interval the minimum mk equals the maximum Mk-except on the interval containing the jump. That jump interval has mk = 0 and Mk = 1. But when we multiply by Axk, and require Axmax -+ 0, the difference between s and S goes to zero. The area under a step function is clear-the rectangles fit exactly.\nRemark 3 With patience another key step could be proved: If s -+ A and S -+ A for one sequence of meshpoints, then this limit A is approached by every choice of meshpoints with Axmax\n, 0. The integral is the lower bound of all upper sums S, and it is the upper bound of all possible s-provided those bounds are equal. The gap must close, to define the integral.\nThe same limit A is approached by \"in-between rectangles.\" The height v(x*) can be computed at any point x* in subinterval k. See Figures 5.9c and 5.10. Then the total rectangular area is a \"Riemann sum\" between s and S:\nS= v(x )Ax 1 + v(x*)Ax 2 + ... + v(x*)Ax.\n(9) We cannot tell whether the true area is above or below S*. Very often A is closer to S* than to s or S. The midpoint rule takes x * in the middle of its interval (Figure 5.10), and Section 5.8 will establish its extra accuracy. The extreme sums s and S are used in the definition while S* is used in computation.\n/4\"\"\n./I right mid min max any x k Fig. 5.10 Various positions for x*' in the base.

It starts with continuity at x*: \"For any e there is a 6 .... \" When the rectangles sit between x* - 6 and x* + 6, the bounds Mk and mk differ by less than 2e. Multiplying by the base Axk, the areas differ by less than 2e(AXk). Combining all rectangles, the upper and lower sums differ by less than 2e(Ax 1 + Ax 2 + ... + Ax,)= 2e(b - a).\nAs e -+ 0 we conclude that S comes arbitrarily close to s. They squeeze in on a single number A. The Riemann sums approach the Riemann integral, ifv is continuous.\nTwo problems are hidden by that reasoning. One is at the end, where S and s come together. We have to know that the line of real numbers has no \"holes,\" so there is a number A to which these sequences converge. That is true.\nAny increasing sequence, if it is bounded above, approaches a limit.\nThe decreasing sequence S, bounded below, converges to the same limit.

We did not allow for the possibility that 6 might approach zero where v(x) is rapidly changing-in which case an infinite number of rectangles could be needed. Our reasoning requires that v(x) is unifomly continuous: 6 depends on E but not on the position of x*.\nFor each E there is a 6 that works at all points in the interval. A continuous function on a closed interval is uniformly continuous. This fact (proof omitted) makes the reasoning correct, and v(x) is integrable.\nOn an infinite interval, even v =x2 is not uniformly continuous. It changes across a subinterval by (x* + ~ 5 ) ~\n-(x* - 6)2=4x*6. As x* gets larger, 6 must get smallerto keep 4x*6 below E. No single 6 succeeds at all x*. But on a finite interval [O, b], the choice 6 =~ / 4 bworks everywhere-so v =x2 is uniformly continuous.\nRemark 5 If those four remarks were fairly optional, this one is totally at your discretion. Modern mathematics needs to integrate the zero-one function V(x) in the first remark. Somehow V has more 0's than 1's. The fractions (where V(x) = 1) can be put in a list, but the irrational numbers (where V(x) =0) are \"uncountable.\" The integral ought to be zero, but Riemann's upper sums all involve M, = 1.\nLebesgue discovered a major improvement. He allowed infinitely many subintervals\n(smaller and smaller). Then all fractions can be covered with intervals of total width E. (Amazing, when the fractions are packed so densely.) The idea is to cover 1/q, 2/q,\n. . . ,q/q by narrow intervals of total width ~ 1 2 ~ .\nCombining all q = 1,2, 3, .. . ,the total width to cover all fractions is no more than E(& +$ +$ + --.)= E.

The definition of the integral is still being studied by experts (and so is the derivative, again to allow more functions). By contrast, the properties of the integral are used by everybody.

But the subject cannot stop there. The integral was defined in order to be used. Its properties are important, and its applications are even more important. The definition was chosen so that the integral has properties that make the applications possible.\nOne direct application is to the average value of v(x). The average of n numbers is clear, and the integral extends that idea-it produces the average of a whole continuum of numbers v(x). This develops from the last rule in the following list (Property 7). We now collect toget her seven basic properties of defirrite integrals.\nThe addition rule for [v(x) + w(x)] dx will not be repeated-even though this property of linearity is the most fundamental. We start instead with a different kind of addition. There is only one function v(x), but now there are two intervals.\nThe integral from a to b is added to its neighbor from b to c. Their sum is the integral from a to c. That is the first (not surprising) property in the list.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 216, "section_id": "s0007-5pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

It also comes from the formal definition of the integral. Rectangular areas obey (1)-with a meshpoint at x = b to make sure. When Axmax approaches zero, their limits also obey (1). All the normal rules for rectangular areas are obeyed in the limit by integrals.\nProperty 1 is worth pursuing. It indicates how to define the integral when a = b.\nThe integral \"from b to b\" is the area over a point, which we expect to be zero. It is.\nProperty 2 fb v(x) dx = 0.\nThat comes from Property 1 when c = b. Equation (1) has two identical integrals, so the one from b to b must be zero.

The \"upper limit\" a is smaller. Going backward reverses the sign:\nProperty 3 fa v(x) dx = - f~ v(x) dx =f(a) -f(b).\nProof When c = a the right side of (1) is zero. Then the integrals on the left side must cancel, which is Property 3. In going from b to a the steps Ax are negative. That justifies a minus sign on the rectangular areas, and a minus sign on the integral\n(Figure 5.1 1b).

We introduce it briefly here, and come back to it in Chapter 8.\nPREDlClABLE AVERAGES FROM RANDOM EVENTS Suppose you throw a pair of dice. The outcome is not predictable. Otherwise why throw them? But the average over more and more throws is totally predictable. We don't know what will happen, but we know its probability.\nFor dice, we are adding two numbers between 1 and 6. The outcome is between 2 and 12. The probability of 2 is the chance of two ones: (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36. Beside each outcome we can write its probability:\nTo repeat, one roll is unpredictable. Only the probabilities are known, and they add to 1. (Those fractions add to 36/36; all possibilities are covered.) The total from a million rolls is even more unpredictable-it can be anywhere between 2,000,000 and 12,000,000. Nevertheless the average of those million outcomes is almost completely predictable. This expected value is found by adding the products in that line above:\nExpected value: multiply (outcome)times (probability of outcome) and add:\nIf you throw the dice 1000 times, and the average is not between 6.9 and 7.1, you get an A. Use the random number generator on a computer and round off to integers.\nNow comes continuous probability. Suppose all numbers between 2 and 12 are equally probable.

The average is 6$, and you see what is coming.\nThese are rectangular areas (Riemann sums). As Ax -+ 0 they approach an integral.\nThe probability of an outcome between x and x + dx is p(x) dx, and this problem has p(x) = 1/10.

The integral of p(x) is 1, because some outcome must happen. The integral of xp(x) is x,,, = 7, the expected value. Each choice of x is random, but the average is predictable.\nThis completes a first step in probability theory. The second step comes after more calculus. Decaying probabilities use e-\" and e-\"'-then the chance of a large x is very small.

I will show quickly how that happens.\nSuppose there are 95 classes of 20 students and 5 classes of 200 students. The total enrollment in 100 classes is 1900 + 1000 = 2900. A random professor has expected class size 29. But a random student sees it differently. The probability is 1900/2900 of being in a small class and 1000/2900 of being in a large class.

Area v(b)db is added, area v(a)da is lost The general case is messier but not much harder (it is quite useful). Suppose both limits are changing. The upper limit b(x) is not necessarily x, but it depends on x.\nThe lower limit a(x) can also depend on x (Figure 5.15b). The area A between those limits changes as x changes, and we want dAldx:\ndA db da v(t) dt then -= v(b(x)) -- v(a(x))-.\ndx dx dx The figure shows two thin strips, one added to the area and one subtracted.\nFirst check the two cases we know. When a = 0 and b = x, we have daldx = 0 and dbldx = 1. The derivative according to (6) is v(x) times 1 -the Fundamental Theorem.\nThe other case has a = x and b = constant. Then the lower limit in (6) produces -v(x).\nWhen the integral goes from a = 2x to b = x3, its derivative is new:\nEXAMPLE 1 A = 5;: cos t dt = sin x3 - sin 2x dAjdx = (cos x3)(3x2) - (cos 2x)(2).\nThat fits with (6), because dbldx is 3x2 and daldx is 2 (with minus sign).

Why does v(- x) have a plus sign?\ndx THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM, PART 2 We have used a hundred times the Theorem that is now to be proved. It is the key to integration. \"The integral of dfldx is f (x) + C.\" The application starts with v(x).\nWe search for an f (x) with this derivative. If dfldx = v(x), the Theorem says that We can't rely on knowing formulas for v and f-only the definitions of and dldx.\nThe proof rests on one extremely special case: dfldx is the zero function. We easily find f (x)= constant. The problem is to prove that there are no other possibilities: f' must be constant. When the slope is zero, the graph must be flat. Everybody knows this is true, but intuition is not the same as proof.\nAssume that df ldx = 0 in an interval. Iff (x) is not constant, there are points where f(a) #f (b). By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point c where f '(c) = (b)-f\n(this is not zero because f (a)#f (b)).\nb - a But f '(c) # 0 directly contradicts df ldx = 0. Therefore f (x) must be constant.\nNote the crucial role of the Mean Value Theorem. A local hypothesis (dfldx = 0 at each point) yields a global conclusion (f = constant in the whole interval). The derivative narrows the field of view, the integral widens it. The Mean Value Theorem connects instantaneous to average, local to global, points to intervals. This special case (the zero function) applies when A(x) and f(x) have the same derivative:\nIfdAldx = dfldx on an interval, then A(x) =f(x) + C.\n(7) Reason: The derivative of A(x) -f(x) is zero. So A(x) -f (x) must be constant.\nNow comes the big theorem. It assumes that v(x) is continuous, and integrates using f (x):\n5D (Fu~tdamental Theorem, Part 2) If u(x) = u(x) dx =f (b) -f (a).\ndx Proof The antiderivative is f (x). But Part 1gave another antiderivative for the same v(x). It was the integral-constructed from rectangles and now called A(x):\ndA v(t)dt alsohas ---=v(x).\ndx Since A' = v and f' = v, the special case in equation (7) states that A(x) =f (x)+ C.\nThat is the essential point: The integral from rectangles equals f (x)+ C.\nAt the lower limit the area integral is A = 0. So f (a)+ C = 0. At the upper limit j'(b) + C = A(b).

Whenever addition becomes \"continuous,\" we have integrals instead of sums. Chapter 8 has space to develop more applications, but four examples can be given immediately--which will make the point.\nWe stay with geometric problems, rather than launching into physics or engineering or biology or economics. All those will come. The goal here is to take a first step away from rectangles.\nEXAMPLE 3 (for circles) The area A and circumference C are related by dA/dr = C.\nThe question is why. The area is 7r2. Its derivative 27nr is the circumference. By the Fundamental Theorem, the integral of C is A. What is missing is the geometrical reason. Certainly rr2 is the integral of 2nrr, but what is the real explanation for A = J C(r) dr?\nMy point is that the pieces are not rectangles. We could squeeze rectangles under a circular curve, but their heights would have nothing to do with C. Our intuition has to take a completely different direction, and add up the thin rings in Figure 5.16.\nshell volume = 4ntr 2Ar Fig. 5.16 Area of circle = integral over rings. Volume of sphere = integral over shells.\nSuppose the ring thickness is Ar. Then the ring area is close to C times Ar.

Dividing both sides by Ar - 0 leaves dA/dr = C.\nFinally there is a geometrical reason. The ring unwinds into a thin strip. Its width is Ar and its length is close to C. The inside and outside circles have different perimeters, so this is not a true rectangle-but the area is near CAr.\nEXAMPLE 4 For a sphere, surface area and volume satisfy A = dV/dr.\nWhat worked for circles will work for spheres. The thin rings become thin shells. A shell goes from radius r to radius r + Ar, so its thickness is Ar. We want the volume of the shell, but we don't need it exactly. The surface area is 47rr2 , so the volume is about 47rr 2 Ar. That is close enough!\nAgain we are correct except for (Ar)2. Infinitesimally speaking dV= A dr:\nV = A dr = 4rr2 dr = rr3 .\nThis is the volume of a sphere. The derivative of V is A, and the shells explain why.\nMain point: Integration is not restricted to rectangles.\nEXAMPLE 5 The distance around a square is 4s. Why does the area have dAlds = 2s?\nThe side is s and the area is s2. Its derivative 2s goes only half way around the square.\nI tried to understand that by drawing a figure. Normally this works, but in the figure dAlds looks like 4s. Something is wrong. The bell is ringing so I leave this as an exercise.\nEXAMPLE6 Find the area under v(x)= cosx from x= 0 to x= 1.\nThat is a conventional problem, but we have no antiderivative for cos- x. We could look harder, and find one. However there is another solution-unconventional but correct. The region can be filled with horizontal rectangles (not vertical rectangles).\nFigure 5.17b shows a typical strip of length x = cos v (the curve has v = cos'- x). As the thickness Av approaches zero, the total area becomes J x dv. We are integrating upward, so the limits are on v not on x:\narea = O2 cos v dv = sin v]-' 2 = 1.\nThe exercises ask you to set up other integrals-not always with rectangles.

The output is the integral I. Our goal is to find that number 1; y(x) dx = I, accurately and in a short time. Normally this goal is achievable-as soon as we have a good method for computing integrals.\nOur two approaches so far have weaknesses. The search for an antiderivative succeeds in important cases, and Chapter 7 extends that range-but generally f ( x ) is not available. The other approach (by rectangles) is in the right direction but too crude. The height is set by y(x) at the right and left end of each small interval. The right and left rectangle rules add the areas (Ax times y):\nR,=(Ax)(y,+y,+ -..+y,) and Ln=(Ax)(yo+yl+ .--+y,-,).\nThe value of y(x) at the end of interval j is yj. The extreme left value yo = y(a) enters L, . With n equal intervals of length Ax = (b- a)/n, the extreme right value is y, = y(b). It enters R,. Otherwise the sums are the same-simple to compute, easy to visualize, but very inaccurate.\nThis section goes from slow methods (rectangles) to better methods (trapezoidal and midpoint) to good methods (Simpson and Gauss).

If f xP dx is the first to be wrong, the order of accuracy is p.\nBy testing the integrals of 1, x, x2, ..., we decide how accurate the formulas are.\nFigure 5.18 shows the rectangle rules R, and L,.\nThey are already wrong when y = x. These methods are first-order: p = 1. The errors involve the first power of Ax-where we would much prefer a higher power.

The error triangles E and e have base Ax. Their heights are the differences yj+ 1 - yj. The areas are\n'(base)(height), and the only difference is a minus sign. (L is too low, so the error L - I is negative.) The total error in R. is the sum of the E's:\nR, - I = ½Ax(y - Yo) + -.- + ½Ax(y - yn-_1)= Ax(y. - yo).\n(1) All y's between Yo and y, cancel. Similarly for the sum of the e's:\nLI\n-\n- ½Ax(Yn - Yo) = - Ax[y(b - y(a)].\n(2) The greater the slope of y(x), the greater the error-since rectangles have zero slope.\nFormulas (1) and (2) are nice-but those errors are large. To integrate y = x from a = 0 to b = 1, the error is ½Ax(1 - 0). It takes 500,000 rectangles to reduce this error to 1/1,000,000. This accuracy is reasonable, but that many rectangles is unacceptable.\nThe beauty of the error formulas is that they are \"asymptotically correct\" for all functions. When the graph is curved, the errors don't fit exactly into triangles. But the ratio of predicted error to actual error approaches 1. As Ax -+ 0, the graph is almost straight in each interval-this is linear approximation.\nThe error prediction ½Ax[y(b) - y(a)] is so simple that we test it on y(x) = x:\nI = o dx n 1 10 100 1000 error R - I=\n.33\n.044\n.0048\n.00049 error L, - I=\n-. 67\n-. 056\n-. 0052\n-. 00051 The error decreases along each row.

We will see these\n((Ax) 2 errors in the trapezoidal rule.\nThe last row in the table is more unusual. It shows practically no error. Why do the rectangle rules suddenly achieve such an outstanding success?\nThe reason is that y(x) = 1/(10 + cos 2nrx) is periodic. The leading term in the error is zero, because y(O) = y(l). Also the next term will be zero, because y'(0) = y'(1). Every power of Ax is multiplied by zero, when we integrate over a complete period. So the errors go to zero exponentially fast.\nPersonal note I tried to integrate 1/(10 + cos 27rx) by hand and failed. Then I was embarrassed to discover the answer in my book on applied mathematics.

Adding those areas gives\n+(L,+ R,) in formula (3)-the coefficients of yj combine into f + f = 1. Only the first and last intervals are missing a neighbor, so the rule has fyo and fy,. Because trapezoids (unlike rectangles) fit under a sloping line, T,, is exact when y = x.\nWhat is the difference from rectangles? The trapezoidal rule gives weight fAx to yo and y,. The rectangle rule R, gives full weight Ax to y, (and no weight to yo).\nR, - T,is exactly the leading error fy, -+yo. The change to T,,knocks out that error.\nAnother important formula is exact for y(x) = x. A rectangle has the same area as a trapezoid, if the height of the rectangle is halfway between yj - and yj . On a straight line graph that is achieved at the midpoint of the interval. By evaluating y(x) at the halfway points fAx, AX, AX, ..., we get much better rectangles.

The trapezoidal error is exactly when y(x) is x2 (the 12 in the formula divides the 2 in y'):\nFor exact error formulas, change yt(b) - yt(a) to (b - a)yM(c).The location of c is unknown (as in the Mean Value Theorem). In practice these formulas are not much used-they involve the pth derivative at an unknown location c. The main point about the error is the factor AX)^.\nOne crucial fact is easy to overlook in our tests. Each value of y(x) can be extremely hard to compute. Every time a formula asks for yj, a computer calls a subroutine. The goal of numerical integration is to get below the error tolerance, while calling for a minimum number of values of y. Second-order rules need about a thousand values for a typical tolerance of The next methods are better.\nFOURTH-ORDER RULE: SIMPSON The trapezoidal error is nearly twice the midpoint error (116 vs. -1/12).

This 1-4-2-4-2-4-1 pattern has become famous.\nSimpson's rule goes deeper than a combination of T and M. It comes from a parabolic approximation to y(x) in each interval. When a parabola goes through yo, Yl/2, yl, the area under it is !Ax(yo + 4 yl/2+ YI). This is S over the first interval. All our rules are constructed this way: Integrate correctly as many powers 1, x, x 2, ... as possible. Parabolas are better than straight lines, which are better than flat pieces.\nS beats M, which beats R. Check Simpson's rule on powers of x, with Ax = 1/n:\nn = 1 n= 10 n= 100 error if y = x2 0 0 0 error if y = x3 0 0 0 error if y = x4 8.33 -10-3 8.33 10-7 8.33.10-11 Exact answers for x2 are no surprise.

The points are not equally spaced! For an integral from 0 to 1, Hewlett-Packard machines might internally replace x by 3u2 - 2u3 (the limits on u are also 0 and 1). The machine remembers to change dx. For example, 1: 5 becomes Algebraically that looks worse-but the infinite value of l/& at x = 0 disappears at u = 0. The differential 6(u - u2) du was chosen to vanish at u = 0 and u = 1. We don't need y(x) at the endpoints-where infinity is most common. In the u variable the integration points are equally spaced-therefore in x they are not.\nWhen a difficult point is inside [a, b], break the interval in two pieces. And chop off integrals that go out to infinity. The integral of epx2 should be stopped by x = 10, since the tail is so thin. (It is bad to go too far.) Rapid oscillations are among the toughest- the answer depends on cancellation of highs and lows, and the calculator requires many integration points.\nThe change from x to u affects periodic functions. I thought equal spacing was good, since 1/(10 + cos 2nx) was integrated above to enormous accuracy. But there is a danger called aliasing. If sin 8nx is sampled with Ax = 118, it is always zero. A high frequency 8 is confused with a low frequency 0 (its \"alias\" which agrees at the sample points). With unequal spacing the problem disappears. Notice how any integration method can be deceived:\nAsk for the integral of y = 0 and specify the accuracy. The calculator samples y at x,, . . . , x,. (With a PAUSE key, the x's may be displayed.) Then integrate Y(x) = (x - x , ) ~ (x - x,)~. That also returns the answer zero (now wrong), because the calculator follows the same steps.\nOn the HP-28s you enter the function, the endpoints, and the accuracy. The variable x can be named or not (see the margin). The outputs 4.67077 and 4.7E-5 are the requested integral ex dx and the estimated error bound. Your input accuracy\n.00001 guarantees The machine estimates accuracy based on its experience in sampling y(x). If you guarantee ex within .00000000001, it thinks you want high accuracy and takes longer.\nIn consulting for HP, William Kahan chose formulas using 1, 3, 7, 15, . . . sample points. Each new formula uses the samples in the previous formula. The calculator stops when answers are close.

They are the basis for slide rules (not so important) and for graphs on log paper (very important). Logarithms are mirror images of exponentials-and those I know you have met.\nStart with exponentials. The numbers 10 and lo2and lo3 are basic to the decimal system. For completeness I also include lo0, which is \"ten to the zeroth power\" or 1. The logarithms of those numbers are the exponents. The logarithms of 1 and 10 and 100 and 1000 are 0 and 1 and 2 and 3. These are logarithms \"to base 10,\"because the powers are powers of 10.\nQuestion When the base changes from 10 to b, what is the logarithm of l?\nAnswer Since b0 = 1, logJ is always zero.

The number 10x is positive, but its exponent x can be negative. The first examples are 1/10 and 1/100, which are the same as 10-' and 10- 2. The logarithms are the exponents -1 and -2:\n1000 = 103 and 1/1000 = 10- 3 and log 1000 = 3 log 1/1000 = - 3.\nMultiplying 1000 times 1/1000 gives 1 = 100.

A slide rule made in Germany would give the third digit in 1.56. Its photograph shows the numbers on a log scale. The distance from 1 to 2 equals the distance from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 8.\nBy sliding the edges, you add distances and multiply numbers.\nDivision goes the other way. Notice how 1000/10 = 100 matches 3 - 1 = 2. To divide 1.56 by 1.3, look back along line D for the answer 1.2.\nThe second figure, though smaller, is the important one. When x increases by 1, 2 x is multiplied by 2. Adding to x multiplies y. This rule easily gives y = 1, 2, 4, 8, but look ahead to calculus-which doesn't stay with whole numbers.\nCalculus will add Ax. Then y is multiplied by 2ax. This number is near 1. If Ax = A then 2\"ax 1.07-the tenth root of 2. To find the slope, we have to consider\n(2ax - 1)/Ax.

The population of the world x years from now is predicted to grow by a factor close to 1.02\". Certainly x does not need to be a whole number of years.\nAnd certainly the base 1.02 should not be 10 (or we are in real trouble). This prediction will be refined as we study the differential equations for growth. It can be rewritten to base 10 if that is preferred (but look at the exponent):\n1.02\" is the same as 10('Og .02)\".\nWhen the base changes from 1.02 to 10, the exponent is multiplied-as we now see.\nFor practice, start with base b and change to base a. The logarithm to base a will be written \"log.\" Everything comes from the rule that logarithm = exponent:\nbase change for numbers: b = dogb.\nNow raise both sides to the power x. You see the change in the exponent:\nbase change for exponentials: bx = a('0g ,Ix.\nFinally set y = bX. Its logarithm to base b is x. Its logarithm to base a is the exponent on the right hand side: logay = (log,b)x. Now replace x by logby:\nbase change for logarithms: log, y = (log, b) (log, y ).\nWe absolutely need this ability to change the base. An example with a = 2 is b = 8 = Z3 g2 = (z3), = 26 log, 64 = 3 2 = (log28)(log864).\nThe rule behind base changes is (am)\" = am\". When the mth power is raised to the xth power, the exponents multiply. The square of the cube is the sixth power:\n(a)(a)(a) times (a)(a)(a) equals (a)(a)(a)(a)(a)(a): (a3),=a6.\nAnother base will soon be more important than 10-here are the rules for base changes:\nThe first is the definition. The second is the xth power of the first. The third is the logarithm of the second (remember y is bx). An important case is y = a:\nlog, a = (log, b)(logb a) = 1 so log, b = 1 /log, a.\n(3) EXAMPLE 8 = 23 means 8lI3 = 2. Then (10g28)(l0g82) = (3)(1/3) = 1.\nThis completes the algebra of logarithms. The addition rules 6A came from\n(bm)(b\") = bm +\". The multiplication rule 68 came from (am)\" = am\". We still need to deJine b\" and ax for all real numbers x. When x is a fraction, the definition is easy.\nThe square root of a8 is a4 (m = 8 times x = 112). When x is not a fraction, as in 2\", the graph suggests one way to fill in the hole.\nWe could defne 2\" as the limit of 23, 231110, 23141100, . . . .

In principle one graph should do the job for both functions, because y =bx means the same as x =logby. These are inverse functions. What one function does, its inverse undoes.

If the first graph is extended to the left, it stays above the x axis. Sketch it in with your pencil. Also extend the second graph down, to be the mirror image. Don't cross the vertical axis.\nFig. 6.2 Exponentials and mirror images (logarithms). Different scales for x and y.\nThere are interesting relations within the left figure. All exponentials start at 1, because b0 is always 1. At the height y = 16, one graph is above x = 2 (because 4' = 16). The other graph is above x = 4 (because 24 = 16). Why does 4\" in one graph equal 2,\" in the other? This is the base change for powers, since 4 = 2,.\nThe figure on the right shows the mirror image-the logarithm. All logarithms start from zero at y = 1. The graphs go down to -co at y = 0. (Roughly speaking 2-\" is zero.) Again x in one graph corresponds to 2x in the other (base change for logarithms). Both logarithms climb slowly, since the exponentials climb so fast.\nThe number log, 10 is between 3 and 4, because 10 is between 23 and 24.

The curves turn virtually straight up.\n2.\nThe most important fact about Ab\" is the value of 6-and the base doesn't stand out in the graph.\nThere is also another point.

Each step down divides by a fixed amount-we never reach zero.

To see why, take logarithms of that equation:\nlog y = log A + x log b.\n(6) The relation between x and log y is linear. It is really log y that is plotted, so the graph is straight. The markings on the y axis allow you to enter y without looking up its logarithm-you get an ordinary graph of log y against x.\nFigure 6.3 shows two examples. One graph is an exact plot of y = 2 loX.

What is dyldx when y = bx? What is dxldy when x is the logarithm logby? Thpse questions are closely related, because bx and logby are inverse functions. If one slope can be found, the other is known from dxldy = l/(dy/dx). The problem is to find one of them, and the exponential comes first.\nYou will now see that those questions have quick (and beautiful) answers, except for a mysterious constant. There is a multiplying factor c which needs more time. I think it is worth separating out the part that can be done immediately, leaving c in dyldx and llc in dxldy. Then Section 6.2 discovers c by studying the special number called e (but c # e).\n6C The derivative of bX is a multiple ebx. The number c depends on the base b.\nI I The product and power and chain rules do not yield this derivative. We are pushed all the way back to the original definition, the limit of AylAx:\nKey idea: Split bx+h into bX times bh. Then the crucial quantity bx factors out. More than that, bx comes outside the limit because it does not depend on h. The remaining limit, inside the brackets, is the number c that we don't yet know:\nThis equation is central to the whole chapter: dyldx equals cbx which equals cy.

Realistically there are two leading candidates for b, and 10 is one of them. This section is about the other one, which is an extremely remarkable number. This number is not seen in arithmetic or algebra or geometry, where it looks totally clumsy and out of place. In calculus it comes into its own.\nThe number is e. That symbol was chosen by Euler (initially in a fit of selfishness, but he was a wonderful mathematician). It is the base of the natural logarithm.\nIt also controls the exponential ex, which is much more important than In x.\nEuler also chose 7c to stand for perimeter-anyway, our first goal is to find e.\nRemember that the derivatives of bx and logby include a constant c that depends on b.

But I want to stay with y' = cy-which is the most important differential equatibn in applied mathematics.\nCompare y' = x with y' = y. The first only asks for an antiderivative of x.

For exponentials, the arrows grow steeper as y grows-the equation is y'= slope = y. Now the arrows are connected by y = Aex.\nA differential equation gives afield of arrows (slopes). Its solution is a curve that stays tangent to the arrows - then the curve has the right slope.\nA field of arrows can show many solutions at once (this comes in a differential equations course). Usually a single Yo is not sacred. To understand the equation we start from many yo-on the left the parabolas stay parallel, on the right the heights stay proportional. For y' = - y all solution curves go to zero.\nFrom y' = y it is a short step to y' = cy. To make c appear in the derivative, put c into the exponent. The derivative of y = ecx is cecx, which is c times y. We have reached the key equation, which comes with an initial condition-a starting value yo:\ndy/dt = cy with y = Yo at t = 0.\n(1) A small change: x has switched to t. In most applications time is the natural variable, rather than space. The factor c becomes the \"growth rate\" or \"decay rate\"-and ecx converts to ect.\nThe last step is to match the initial condition. The problem requires y = Yo at t = 0. Our ec' starts from ecO = 1. The constant of integration is needed now-the solutions are y = Ae\". By choosing A = Yo, we match the initial condition and solve equation (1). The formula to remember is yoec'.\n61 The exponential law y = yoec' solves y' = cy starting from yo.\nThe rate of growth or decay is c. May I call your attention to a basic fact? The formula yoec' contains three quantities Yo, c, t. If two of them are given, plus one additional piece of information, the third is determined. Many applications have one of these three forms: find t, find c, find yo.\n1. Find the doubling time T if c = 1/10. At that time yoecT equals 2yo:\nIn 2\n.7 e T = 2 yields cT= In 2 so that T= I\n--.\n(2) c\n.1 The question asks for an exponent T The answer involves logarithms. If a cell grows at a continuous rate of c = 10% per day, it takes about .7/.1 = 7 days to double in size. (Note that .7 is close to In 2.) If a savings account earns 10% continuous interest, it doubles in 7 years.\nIn this problem we knew c. In the next problem we know T 2. Find the decay constant c for carbon-14 if y = ½yo in T= 5568 years.\necr = 4 yields cT= In I so that c (In 5)/5568.\n(3) After the half-life T= 5568, the factor ecT equals 4. Now c is negative (In = - In 2).\nQuestion 1 was about growth. Question 2 was about decay. Both answers found ecT as the ratio y(T)/y(O). Then cT is its logarithm. Note how c sticks to T.\nT has the units of time, c has the units of \"1/time.\" Main point: The doubling time is (In 2)/c, because cT= In 2. The time to multiply by e is 1/c. The time to multiply by 10 is (In 10)/c. The time to divide by e is - 1/c, when a negative c brings decay.\n3.

We count the past population to find c. Changes in c are a serious problem for this model.\nSecond comment: yoect is not a whole number. You may prefer to think of bacteria instead of people. (This section begins a major application of mathematics to economics and the life sciences.) Malthus based his theory of human population on this equation y' = cy-and with large numbers a fraction of a person doesn't matter so much. To use calculus we go from discrete to continuous. The theory must fail when t is very large, since populations cannot grow exponentially forever. Section 6.5 introduces the logistic equation y' = cy - by2, with a competition term -by2 to slow the growth.\nThird comment: The dimensions of b, c, d are \"l/time.\" The dictionary gives birth rate = number of births per person in a unit of time. It is a relative rate-people divided by people and time. The product ct is dimensionless and ect makes sense (also dimensionless). Some texts replace c by 1-(lambda).

For the price change Ay over a year, use the annual rate:\nAy = (annual rate) times (y) times (At).\n(5) Calculus applies the continuous rate to each instant dt. The price change is dy:\nk dy = (continuous rate) times (y) times (dt).\n(6) Dividing by dt, this is a differential equation for the price:\ndyldt = (continuous rate) times (y) = .05y.\nThe solution is yoe.05'.Set t = 1. Then emo5= 1.0513 and the annual rate is 5.13%.\nWhen you ask a bank what interest they pay, they give both rates: 8% and 8.33%.\nThe higher one they call the \"effective rate.\" It comes from compounding (and depends how often they do it). If the compounding is continuous, every dt brings an increase of dy-and eeo8is near 1.0833.\nSection 6.6 returns to compound interest. The interval drops from a month to a day to a second. That leads to (1 + lln)\", and in the limit to e. Here we compute the effect of 5% continuous interest:\nFuture value A dollar now has the same value as esoSTdollars in T years.\nPresent value A dollar in T years has the same value as e--OSTdollars now.\nDoubling time Prices double (emosT= 2) in T= In 21.05 x 14 years.\nWith no compounding, the doubling time is 20 years. Simple interest adds on 20 times 5% = 100%. With continuous compounding the time is reduced by the factor In 2 z -7, regardless of the interest rate.\nEXAMPLE 4 In 1626 the Indians sold Manhattan for $24.

After t = 365 years the multiplier is e29.2and the $24 has grown to 115 trillion dollars. With that much money they could buy back the land and pay off the national debt.\nThis seems farfetched.

Up to now, all growth or decay has started from yo. No deposit or withdrawal was made later. The investment grew by itself-a pure exponential. The new term s allows you to add or subtract from the account. It is a \"source\"-or a \"sink\" if s is negative. The source s = 5 adds 5dt, proportional to dt but not to y:\nConstant source: dyldt = y + 5 starting from y = yo.\nNotice y on both sides! My first guess y = et+' failed completely. Its derivative is et+' again, which is not y + 5. The class suggested y = et + 5t. But its derivative et + 5 is still not y + 5. We tried other ways to produce 5 in dyldt. This idea is doomed to failure. Finally we thought of y = Aet - 5. That has y' = Aet = y + 5 as required.\nImportant: A is not yo. Set t = 0 to find yo = A - 5. The source contributes 5et - 5:\nThe solution is (yo+ 5)e' - 5. That is the same as yOef+ 5(et- 1).\ns = 5 multiplies the growth term ef - 1 that starts at zero. yoef grows as before.\nEXAMPLE 5 dyldt = -y + 5 has y = (yo- 5)e-' + 5.

The equation feeds in $1000 or removes $200 continuously-not all 0\n-5e-'+5 at once.\n1 Note again that y = e(c+s)tis not a solution. Its derivative is (c + sly. The combinaRgmdm9 tion y = ect+ s is also not a solution (but closer). The analysis of y' = cy + s will be our main achievement for dzrerential equations (in this section).

The first way is the fastest-only three lines-but please give the others a chance. There is no point in preparing for real problems if we don't solve them.\nSolution by Method 1 (fast way) Substitute the combination y = Aec' + B.

From two facts we find A and B:\nthe equation y' = cy + s gives cAect = c(Aect+ B) + s the initial value at t = 0 gives A + B = yo.\ntMy class says one way is more than enough.

It succeeded because we knew the form A&'+ B-with\n\"undetermined coefficients.\" Method 2 is more complete. The form for y is part of the output, not the input. The source s is a continuous supply of new deposits, all growing separately. Section 6.5 starts from scratch, by directly integrating y' = cy + s.\nRemark Method 2 is often described in terms of an integrating factor. First write the equation as y' -cy = s.

The bank gives up more than the $20,000 to buy your car (and pay tuition). It also gives up the interest on that money. You pay that back too, but you don't have to stay even at every moment. Instead you repay at a constant rate for 20 years. Your payments mostly cover interest at the start and principal at the end. After t = 20 years you are even and your debt is y = 0.\nThis is like Question 5 (also y = O), but now we know yo and we want s:\ny = yoec'+ - S (ec' - 1)= 0 requires s = - cyoec'/(ec'- 1).\nC The loan is yo = $20,000, the rate is c = .05/year, the time is t = 20 years. Substituting in the formula for s, your payments are $1582 per year.\nPuzzle How is s = $1582 for loan payments related to s = $582 for deposits?\n0 -+ $582 per year +$20,000 and $20,000 + - $1582 per year +0.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 259, "section_id": "s0008-6pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Here is the real reason. Instead of repaying 1582 we can pay only 1000 (to keep even with the interest on 20,000). The other 582 goes into a separate account.\nAfter 20 years the continuous 582 has built up to 20,000 (including interest as in Question 4). From that account we pay back the loan.\nSection 6.6 deals with daily compounding-which differs from continuous compounding by only a few cents.

That is the \"transient\" term, which disappears as t -+ co. What is left is the\n\"steady state.\" We denote that limit by y.\nWithout a source, y, is zero (total decay). When s is present, y, = - s/c:\n6J The solution y = Yo + - e\" - - approaches y, =-\n- when ec -*0.\nAt this steady state, the source s exactly balances the decay cy. In other words cy + s = 0. From the left side of the differential equation, this means dy/dt = 0. There is no change. That is why y, is steady.\nNotice that y. depends on the source and on c-but not on yo.\nEXAMPLE 6 Suppose Bermuda has a birth rate b = .02 and death rate d = .03. The net decay rate is c = - .01. There is also immigration from outside, of s = 1200/year.\nThe initial population might be Yo = 5 thousand or Yo = 5 million, but that number has no effect on yo. The steady state is independent of yo.\nIn this case y. = - s/c = 1200/.01 = 120,000. The population grows to 120,000 if Yo is smaller. It decays to 120,000 if Yo is larger.\nEXAMPLE 7 Newton's Law of Cooling:\ndy/dt = c(y - y.).\n(12) This is back to physics. The temperature of a body is y. The temperature around it is y.. Then y starts at Yo and approaches y,, following Newton's rule: The rate is proportional to y - y. The bigger the difference, the faster heat flows.\nThe equation has - cy. where before we had s.

Here ln p(x) = x in x + f ln(x - 1).\n1 Take the derivative of In p: l d p = x . - + l n x + - 1 pdx x 2(x - 1)' Now multiply by p(x):\nThe catch is that last step. Multiplying by p complicates the answer. This can't be helped-logarithmic differentiation contains no magic. The derivative of p =fg is the same as from the product rule: In p = lnf + In g gives For p = xex sin x, with three factors, the sum has three terms:\nIn p = l n x + x + l n sin x and p l = p L We multiply p times pl/p (the derivative of In p). Do the same for powers:\nINTEGRALS BASED ON LOGARITHMS Now comes an important step. Many integrals produce logarithms. The foremost example is llx, whose integral is In x. In a certain way that is the only example, but its range is enormously extended by the chain rule. The derivative of In u(x) is uf/u, so the integral goes from ul/u back to In u:\ndx = ln u(x) or equivalently\n= In u.\nTry to choose u(x) so that the integral contains duldx divided by u.\nEXAMPLES", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 267, "section_id": "s0008-6pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

To remove the extra 1, subtract x from the integral: Iln x dx = x in x -x.\nIn contrast, the area under l/(ln x) has no elementary formula.

The answer comes directly from the two separate integrations. When a differential equation is reduced that farto integrals that we know or can look up-it is solved.\nOne particular equation will be emphasized. The logistic equation describes the speedup and slowdown of growth. Its solution is an S-curve, which starts slowly, rises quickly, and levels off. (The 1990's are near the middle of the S, if the prediction is correct for the world population.) S-curves are solutions to nonlinear equations, and we will be solving our first nonlinear model.

The growth rate c is the birth rate minus the death rate. If c is constant the growth goes on forever-beyond the point where the model is reasonable. A population can't grow all the way to infinity!\nEventually there is competition for food and space, and y = ect must slow down.\nThe true rate c depends on the population size y. It is a function c(y) not a constant.\nThe choice of the model is at least half the problem:\nProblem in biology or ecology:\nDiscover c(y).\nProblem in mathematics:\nSolve dyldt = c(y)y.\nEvery model looks linear over a small range of y's-but not forever. When the rate drops off, two models are of the greatest importance. The Michaelis-Menten equation has c(y) = c/(y + K). The logistic equation has c(y) = c - by. It comes first.\nThe nonlinear effect is from \"interaction.\" For two populations of size y and z, the number of interactions is proportional to y times z. The Law of Mass Action produces a quadratic term byz. It is the basic model for interactions and competition. Here we have one population competing within itself, so z is the same as y. This competition slows down the growth, because -by2 goes into the equation.\nThe basic model of growth versus competition is known as the logistic equation:\nNormally b is very small compared to c.

The rate constant is 6, and you see the product of \"enzyme times substrate.\" A similar law governs the other reactions\n(some go backwards). The equations are nonlinear, with no exact solution. It is typical of applied mathematics (and nature) that a pattern can still be found.\nWhat happens is that the enzyme concentration z(t) quickly drops to z, K/(y + K).\nThe Michaelis constant K depends on the rates (like 6) in the mass action laws.\nLater the enzyme reappears (z, = 2,). But by then the first reaction is over. Its law of mass action is effectively with c =.bz,K. This is the Michaelis-Menten equation-basic to biochemistry.\nThe rate dyldt is all-important in biology.

(We include extra information about bank rates, hoping this may be useful some day.) The applications in science and engineering are equally important. Scientific computing, like accounting, has diflerence equations in parallel with differential equations.\nKnowing that this section will be full of formulas, I would like to jump ahead and tell you the best one. It is an infinite series for ex. What makes the series beautiful is that its derivative is itself:\nStart with y = 1 + x. This has y = 1 and yt = 1 at x = 0. But y\" is zero, not one.\nSuch a simple function doesn't stand a chance! No polynomial can be its own derivative, because the highest power xn drops down to nxn-l. The only way is to have no highest power. We are forced to consider infinitely many terms-a power series-to achieve \"derivative equals function.'' To produce the derivative 1 + x, we need 1 + x + ix2. Then ix2 is the derivative of Ax3, which is the derivative of &x4. The best way is to write the whole series at once:\nInfinite series ex = 1 + x + ix2 + 4x3 + &x4 + -.\n(1) This must be the greatest power series ever discovered. Its derivative is itself:\nThe derivative of each term is the term before it. The integral of each term is the one after it (so j exdx = ex + C). The approximation ex = 1 + x appears in the first two terms. Other properties like (ex)(ex) = eZX are not so obvious. (Multiplying series is hard but interesting.) It is not even clear why the sum is 2.718 ... when x = 1.\nSomehow 1 + 1 + f + & + equals e. That is where (1 + lln)\" will come in.\nNotice that xn is divided by the product 1 2 3 * - . - n. This is \"n factorial.\" Thus x4 is divided by 1 2 - 3 4 = 4! = 24, and xS is divided by 5! = 120. The derivative of\n.\nx5/120 is x4/24, because 5 from the derivative cancels 5 from the factorial. In general xn/n! has derivative xn - '/(n - l)! Surprisingly O! is 1.\nChapter 10 emphasizes that xn/n! becomes extremely small as n increases. The infinite series adds up to a finite number-which is ex.

That loan was apparently never repaid.\nSo Mr. DeHaven's descendants are taking the United States Government to court to collect what they believe they are owed. The total: $141 billion if the interest is compounded daily at 6 percent, the going rate at the time. If compounded yearly, the bill is only $98 billion.\nThe thousands of family members scattered around the country say they are not being greedy. \"It's not the money-it's the principle of the thing,\" said Carolyn Cokerham, a DeHaven on her father's side who lives in San Antonio.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 279, "section_id": "s0008-6pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

He had no children.\nC O M P O U N D INTEREST The idea of compound interest can be applied right away. Suppose you invest $1000 at a rate of 100% (hard to do). If this is the annual rate, the interest after a year is another $1000. You receive $2000 in all. But if the interest is compounded you receive more:\nafter six months: Interest of $500 is reinvested to give $1500 end of year: New interest of $750 (50% of 1500) gives $2250 total.\nThe bank multiplied twice by 1.5 (1000 to 1500 to 2250). Compounding quarterly multiplies four times by 1.25 (1 for principal, .25 for interest):\nafter one quarter the total is 1000 + (.25)(1000) = 1250 after two quarters the total is 1250 + (.25)(1250)= 1562.50 after nine months the total is 1562.50 + (.25)(1562.50)= 1953.12 after a full year the total is 1953.12 + (.25)(@53. 12) = 2441.41 Each step multiplies by 1 + (l/n), to add one nth of a year's interest-still at 100%:\nquarterly conversion: (1 + 1/4)4x low = 2441.41 monthly conversion: (1 + 1/12)\" x 1Qh= 2613.04 daily conversion: (1 + 1/365)36% 1000 = 2714.57.\nMany banks use 360 days in a year, although computers have made that obsolete.\nVery few banks use minutes (525,600 per year).

Now we solve the corresponding difference equations.\nAbove all, the goal is to see the connections. The purpose of mathematics is to understand and explain patterns. The path from \"discrete to continuous\" is beautifully illustrated by these equations. Not every class will pursue them to the end, but I cannot fail to show the pattern in a difference equation:\nEach step multiplies by the same number a.

Demand next time equals supply next time: D(t + 1)= S(t + 1).\nComment on 3: the price sets itself to make demand = supply. The demand slope -d is negative. The supply slope c is positive. Those lines intersect at the competitive price, where supply equals demand. To find the difference equation, substitute 1 and 2 into 3:\nDifference equation: -dP(t + 1)+ b = cP(t) Steady state price:\n-dP, + b = cP,. Thus P, = b/(c + d).\nIf the price starts above P,, the difference equation brings it down. If below, the price goes up. When the price is P,, it stays there. This is not news-economic theory depends on approach to a steady state. But convergence only occurs if c < d.\nIf supply is less sensitive than demand, the economy is stable.\nBlow-up example: c = 2, b = d = 1.

The mortgage on my home has N = (12)(25) monthly payments with interest rate i =\n.07/12. In 1972 the present value was $42,000 = amount borrowed. I am now going to see if the bank is honest.?\nRemark In many loans, the bank computes interest on the amount paid back instead of the amount received. This is called discounting. A loan of $1000 at 5% for one year costs $50 interest. Normally you receive $1000 and pay back $1050.\nWith discounting you receive $950 (called the proceeds) and you pay back $1000.\nThe true interest rate is higher than 5%-because the $50 interest is paid on the smaller amount $950. In this case the \"discount rate\" is 501950 = 5.26%.\nSCIENTIFIC COMPUTING: DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS BY DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS In biology and business, most events are discrete. In engineering and physics, time and space are continuous. Maybe at some quantum level it's all the same, but the equations of physics (starting with Newton's law F = ma) are differential equations.\nThe great contribution of calculus is to model the rates of change we see in nature.\nBut to solve that model with a computer, it needs to be made digital and discrete.\nThese paragraphs work with dyldt = cy. It is the test equation that all analysts use, as soon as a new computing method is proposed. Its solution is y = ect, starting from yo = 1. Here we test Euler's method (nearly ancient, and not well thought of). He replaced dyldt by AylAt:\nThe left side is dyldt, in the limit At +0. We stop earlier, when At > 0.\nThe problem is to solve (13). Multiplying by At, the equation is y(t + At) = (1 + cAt)y(t)\n(with y(0) = 1).\nEach step multiplies by a = 1 + cAt, so n steps multiply by an:\ny = an= (1 + cAt)\" at time nAt.\n(14) This is growth or decay, depending on a. The correct ectis growth or decay, depending on c. The question is whether an and eczstay close. Can one of them grow while the other decays? We expect the difference equation to copy y' = cy, but we might be wrong.\nA good example is y' = -y. Then c = - 1 and y = e-'-the true solution decays.\n?It's not. s is too big.

The calculation of areas was started-by hand or computer. Chapter 6 opened a different door. Its new functions ex and In x led to differential equations. You might say that all along we have been solving the special differential equation dfldx = v(x). The solution is f = 1 v(x)dx. But the step to dyldx = cy was a breakthrough.\nThe truth is that we are able to do remarkable things. Mathematics has a language, and you are learning to speak it. A short time ago the symbols dyldx and J'v(x)dx were a mystery. (My own class was not too sure about v(x) itself-the symbol for a function.) It is easy to forget how far we have come, in looking ahead to what is next.\nI do want to look ahead. For integrals there are two steps to take-more functions and more applications. By using mathematics we make it live. The applications are most complete when we know the integral. This short chapter will widen (very much) the range of functions we can integrate. A computer with symbolic algebra widens it more.\nUp to now, integration depended on recognizing derivatives. If v(x) = sec2x then f(x) = tan x. To integrate tan x we use a substitution:, I!&dx.=-1\"-- - In u = -In cos x.\nU What we need now ,are techniques for other integrals, to change them around until we can attack them. Two examples are j x cos x dx and 5 ,/- dx, which are not immediately recognizable. With integration by parts, and a new substitution, they become simple.\nThose examples indicate where this chapter starts and stops. With reasonable effort\n(and the help of tables, which is fair) you can integrate important functions. With intense effort you could integrate even more functions. In older books that extra exertion was made-it tended to dominate the course. They had integrals like which we could work on if we had to. Our time is too valuable for that! Like long division, the ideas are for us and their intricate elaboration is for the computer.\nIntegration by parts comes first. Then we do new substitutions. Partial fractions is a useful idea (already applied to the logistic equation y' = cy - by2). In the last section x goes to infinity or y(x) goes to infinity-but the area stays finite. These improper integrals are quite common. Chapter 8 brings the applications.\n,/-, l)dx/\n+ J(x", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 294, "section_id": "s0009-7pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Substitutions are based on the chain rule, and more are ahead. Here we present the other method, based on the product rule. The reverse of the product rule, to find integrals not derivatives, is integration by parts.\nWe have mentioned J cos2x dx and J In x dx. Now is the right time to compute them (plus more examples). You will see how J In x dx is exchanged for J 1 dx-a definite improvement. Also J xex dx is exchanged for J ex dx. The difference between the harder integral and the easier integral is a known term-that is the point.\nOne note before starting: Integration by parts is not just a trick with no meaning.\nOn the contrary, it expresses basic physical laws of equilibrium and force balance.\nIt is a foundation for the theory of differential equations (and even delta functions).\nThe final paragraphs, which are completely optional, illustrate those points too.\nWe begin with the product rule for the derivative of u(x) times v(x):\ndv du d u(x)\n+ v(x)d - d (u(x)v(x)).\n(1) dx dx dx Integrate both sides. On the right, integration brings back u(x)v(x). On the left are two integrals, and one of them moves to the other side (with a minus sign):\nu(x) dx = u(x)v(x) - v(x) dx.\n(2) That is the key to this section-not too impressive at first, but very powerful. It is integration by parts (u and v are the parts). In practice we write it without x's:\n7A The integration by parts formula is j u dv = uv - Jv du.\n(3) The problem of integrating u dv/dx is changed into the problem of integrating v du/dx. There is a minus sign to remember, and there is the \"integrated term\" u(x)v(x).\nIn the definite integral, that product u(x)v(x) is evaluated at the endpoints a and b:\nLb dv du u dx\n- u(b)v(b) - u(a)v(a) - v dx.\n(4) a dx dx The key is in choosing u and v. The goal of that choice is to make 5 v du easier than j u dv. This is best seen by examples.\nEXAMPLE 1 For f In x dx choose u = In x and dv = dx (so v= x):\nIn xdx = uv - v du = x ln x - x dx.\nI used the basic formula (3). Instead of working with In x (searching for an antiderivative), we now work with the right hand side. There x times l/x is 1. The integral of 1 is x. Including the minus sign and the integrated term uv = x In x and the constant C, the answer is J In x dx = x In x - x + C.\n(5) For safety, take the derivative. The product rule gives In x + x(1/x) - 1, which is In x.\nThe area under y = In x from 2 to 3 is 3 In 3 - 3 - 2 In 2 + 2.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 295, "section_id": "s0009-7pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

We could have chosen u = cos x and dv = x dx. Then v = fx2. Integration using those parts give the true but useless result The last integral is harder instead of easier (x2 is worse than x). In the forward direction this is no help. But in the opposite direction it simplifies Sf x2 sin x dx.

Delta function (area 1) multiplies v(x) at x = 0.\nIn the movie Stand and Deliver, the Los Angeles teacher Jaime Escalante computed J x2sin x dx with two integrations by parts. His success was through exercises-plus insight in choosing u and v. (Notice the difference from f x sin x2 dx. That falls the other way-to a substitution.) The class did extremely well on the Advanced Placement Exam. If you saw the movie, you remember that the examiner didn't believe it was possible. I spoke to him long after, and he confirms that practice was the key.\nTHE DELTA FUNCTION From the most familiar functions we move to the least familiar. The delta function is the derivative of a step function. The step function U(x) jumps from 0 to 1 at x = 0.\nWe write 6(x) = dU/dx, recognizing as we do it that there is no genuine derivative at the jump. The delta function is the limit of higher and higher spikes-from the\n\"burst of speed\" in Section 1.2. They approach an infinite spike concentrated at a single point (where U jumps). This \"non-function\" may be unconventional--it is certainly optional-but it is important enough to come back to.\nThe slope dU/dx is zero except at x = 0, where the step function jumps. Thus 6(x) = 0 except at that one point, where the delta function has a \"spike.\" We cannot give a value for 6 at x = 0, but we know its integral across the jump. On every interval from - A to A, the integral of dU/dx brings back U:\n-A 6(x) dx= - dx d= U(x)] A = 1.\n(13)\n\"The area under the infinitely tall and infinitely thin spike 6(x) equals 1.\" So far so good. The integral of 6(x) is U(x). We now integrate by parts for a crucial purpose-tofind the area under v(x)6(x). This is an ordinary function times the delta function. In some sense v(x) times 6(x) equals v(O) times 6(x)-because away from x = 0 the product is always zero. Thus ex6(x) equals 6(x), and sin x 6(x) = 0.\nU2 U1 0", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 297, "section_id": "s0009-7pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

But multiplying infinity is dangerous, to say the least. (Two times infinity is infinity). We cannot deal directly with the delta function. It is only known by its integrals! As long as the applications produce integrals (as they do), we can avoid the fact that 6 is not a true function.\nThe integral of v(x)6(x)= v(x)dU/dx is computed \"by parts:\" v(x)6(x) dx = v(x)U(x)] A - U(x) dx.\n(14)\n-A\n-\n-A dx Remember that U = 0 or U = 1.

Power is voltage times current. Income is price times quantity. When there are several forces or currents or sales, we add the products. When there are infinitely many, we integrate (probably by parts).\nI start with differential equations for the displacement u at point x in a bar:\ndv du S= f(x) with v(x) = k\n(16) dx dx This describes a hanging bar pulled down by a forcef(x). Each point x moves through a distance u(x). The top of the bar is fixed, so u(0)= 0. The stretching in the bar is du/dx. The internal force created by stretching is v = k du/dx. (This is Hooke's law.) Equation (16) is a balance of forces on the small piece of the bar in Figure 7.2.\n0 W Fig. 7.2 Difference in internal force balances external force\n- Av =fAx or -dv/dx =f(x) v = W at x = 1 balances hanging weight 286", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 298, "section_id": "s0009-7pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

At x = 1 we are given v = W so C = W +F. Then v(x) and u(x)give force and displacement in the bar.\nTo see integration by parts, multiply -dvldx = f(x) by u(x)and integrate:\n] f(x)u(x) dx = -] u(x) dx = - u(x)v(x)]i+ ] v(x) dx.\n0 0 dx o dx The left side is force times displacement, or external work.

The balance of forces has been replaced by a balance of work.\nThis is a touch of engineering mathematics, and here is the main point. Integration by parts makes physical sense!

The integral of cos2x is already known.

I believe these are the most important definite integrals in this chapter (p and q are 0, 1,2, . . .). They may be the most important in all of mathematics, especially because the question has such a beautiful answer. The integrals are zero. On that fact rests the success of Fourier series, and the whole industry of signal processing.\nOne approach (the slow way) is to replace sin 8x and cos 6x by powers of cosines.\nThat involves cos14x. The integration is not fun. A better approach, which applies to all angles px and qx, is to use the identity sin px cos qx =f sin(p + q)x +f sin(p - q)x.\n(8) Thus sin 8x cos 6x =f sin 14x +f sin 2x.

Subtraction gives zero.\nThe same is true for cos 2x. The integral of sine times cosine is always zero over a complete period (like 0 to 2n).\nWhat about sin px sin qx and cos px cos qx? Their integrals are also zero, provided p is dinerent from q. When p = q we have a perfect square. There is no negative area to cancel the positive area. The integral of cos2px or sin2px is n.\nEXAMPLE 7 I:\" sin 8x sin 7x dx = 0 and I:\" sin2 8x dx = n.\nWith two sines or two cosines (instead of sine times cosine), we go back to the addition formulas of Section 1.5. Problem 24 derives these formulas:\nsin px sin qx = -4 cos(p + q)x + cos(p - q)x\n(9) cos px cos qx = + cos(p + q)x +9cos(p - q)x.\n(10) With p = 8 and q = 7, we get cos 15x and cos x. Their definite integrals are zero. With p = 8 and q = 8, we get cos 16x and cos Ox (which is 1). Formulas (9) and (10) also give a factor f . The integral of f is n:\n1:\" sin 8x sin 7x dx = -f1:\" cos 15x dx + $I:\" cos x dx = 0 + 0 1:\" sin 8x sin 8x dx = -)I:\" coCl6x dx + fI:\" cos Ox dx = 0 + n The answer zero is memorable. The answer n appears constantly in Fourier series.\nNo ordinary numbers are seen in these integrals. The case p = q = 1 brings back cos2x dx =f + t sin 2x.\nSECANTS AND TANGENTS When we allow negative powers m and n, the main fact remains true. All integrals I sinmx cosnx dx can be expressed by known functions. The novelty for negative powers is that logarithms appear.

If n is even we substitute u = tan x. If m is odd we set u = sec x. If m is even and n is odd, use a reduction formula (and always use tan2x = sec2x- 1).\nI mention very briefly a completely different substitution u = tan ix.

The device for removing linear terms is worth knowing. It is called completing the square, and two examples will begin to explain it:\nx 2 - 2 x + 2 = ( x - 1 = u 2 + 1 The idea has three steps. First, get the x2 and x terms into one square. Here that square was (x - 1)2= x2 - 2x + 1. Second, fix up the constant term. Here we recover the original functions by adding 1. Third, set u = x - 1 to leave no linear term. Then the integral goes forward based on the substitutions of this section:\nThe same idea applies to any quadratic that contains a linear term 2bx:\nrewrite x2 + 2bx + c as\n(x + b)2+ C, with C = c - b2 rewrite - x2 + 2bx + c as - (x - b)2+ C, with C = c + b2 To match the quadratic with the square, we fix up the constant:\nx2 + lox + 16=\n(x + 5)2+ C leads to C = 16 - 25 = -9\n- x 2 + lox+ 16= -(x- 5)*+ C leads to C = 16+25=41.\nEXAMPLE 9 Here u = x + 5 and du = dx.

Then go backwards from 8 to u to x.\nFinal remark For u2 + aZ we substitute u = a tan 8. For u2 - a2 we substitute u = a sec 8.

We meet them again in a sum of simple cases:\nOur plan is to split PIQ into a sum like this-and integrate each piece.\nWhich rational function produced that particular sum? It was This is PIQ. It is a ratio of polynomials, degree 1 over degree 3. The pieces of P are collected into -4x + 16. The common denominator (x - 2)(x + 2)(x)= x3 - 4x is Q.\nBut I kept these factors separate, for the following reason. When we start with PIQ, and break it into a sum of pieces, thefirst things we need are the factors of Q.\nIn the standard problem PIQ is given. To integrate it, we break it up. The goal of partial fractions is to find the pieces-to prepare for integration. That is the technique to learn in this section, and we start right away with examples.\nEXAMPLE 1 Suppose PIQ has the same Q but a different numerator P:\nNotice the form of those pieces! They are the \"partial fractions\" that add to PIQ.\nEach one is a constant divided by a factor of Q. We know the factors x - 2 and x + 2 and x. We don't know the constants A, B, C. In the previous case they were 1,3, -4.\nIn this and other examples, there are two ways to find them.\nMethod 1(slow) Put the right side of (1) over the common denominator Q:\nWhy is A multiplied by (x + 2)(x)? Because canceling those factors will leave A/(x - 2) as in equation (1). Similarly we have B/(x + 2) and Clx. Choose the numbers A, B, C so that the numerators match. As soon as they agree, the splitting is correct.\nMethod 2 (quicker) Multiply equation (1) by x - 2. That leaves a space:\nNow set x = 2 and immediately you have A. The last two terms of (3) are zero, because x - 2 is zero when x = 2. On the left side, x = 2 gives Notice how multiplying by x - 2 produced a hole on the left side. Method 2 is the\n\"cover-up method.\" Cover up x - 2 and then substitute x = 2. The result is 3 = A + 0 + 0, just what we wanted.\nIn Method 1, the numerators of equation (2) must agree. The factors that multiply B and C are again zero at x = 2. That leads to the same A-but the cover-up method avoids the unnecessary step of writing down equation (2).", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 313, "section_id": "s0009-7pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Just cover up in Q and give x the right value (which makes the covered factor zero).\nCalculation of C (quickest) In equation (I), cover up the factor (x) and set x = 0:\nTo repeat: The same result A = 3, B = - 1, C = 1 comes from Method 1.\nEXAMPLE 2 First cover up (x - 1) on the left and set x = 1.

That covers up y in the first two terms and changes B to By.\nThen set y = 0. The equation becomes l/c = A.\nTo find B, multiply by c - by. That covers up c - by in the outside terms. In the middle, A times c - by will be zero at y = clb. That leaves B on the right equal to l/y = blc on the left. Then A = llc and B = blc give the integral announced in Equation 6.5.9:\nIt is time to admit that the general method of partial fractions can be very awkward.\nFirst of all, it requires the factors of the denominator Q. When Q is a quadratic ax2+ bx + c, we can find its roots and its factors. In theory a cubic or a quartic can also be factored, but in practice only a few are possible-for example x4 - 1 is\n(x2- 1)(x2+ 1). Even for this good example, two of the roots are imaginary. We can split x2 - 1 into (x + l)(x - 1). We cannot split x2 + 1 without introducing i.\nThe method of partial fractions can work directly with x2 + 1, as we now see.\nEXAMPLE 4 dx (a quadratic over a quadratic).\nThis has another difficulty.

Therefore I divide the leading term x2 into the leading term 3x2. That gives 3, which is separated off by itself:\nNote how 3 really used 3x2 + 3 from the original numerator. That left 2x + 4. Partial fractions will accept a linear factor 2x + 4 (or Ax + B, not just A) above a quadratic.\nThis example contains 2x/(x2 + I), which integrates to ln(x2 + 1). The final 4/(x2 + 1) integrates to 4 tan-'x. When the denominator is x2 + x + 1 we complete the square before integrating. The point of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 was to make that integration possible. This section gets the fraction ready-in parts.\nThe essential point is that we never have to go higher than quadratics. Every denominator Q can be split into linear factors and quadratic factors. There is no magic way to find those factors, and most examples begin by giving them. They go into their own fractions, and they have their own numerators-which are the A and B and 2x + 4 we have been computing.\nThe one remaining question is what to do if a factor is repeated. This happens in Example 5.\nEXAMPLE 5 The key is the new term B/(x - That is the right form to expect. With (x - l)(x - 2) this term would have been B/(x - 2). But when (x - 1) is repeated, something new is needed. To find B, multiply through by (x - and set x = 1:\n2 x + 3 = A(x- 1)+ B becomes 5 = B when x = 1.\nThis cover-up method gives B. Then A = 2 is easy, and the integral is 2 lnlx - 11 - 5/(x - 1). The fraction 5/(x - 1)2 has an integral without logarithms.\nEXAMPLE 6 This final example has almost everything! It is more of a game than a calculus problem. In fact calculus doesn't enter until we integrate (and nothing is new there).\nBefore computing A, B, C, D, E, we write down the overall rules for partial fractions:\nThe degree of P must be less than the degree of Q. Otherwise divide their leading terms as in equation (8) to lower the degree of P. Here 3 < 5.\nExpect the fractions illustrated by Example 6.

It makes better sense to show that it works once, in Example 6.\nTo find E, cover up (x - 1) on the left and substitute x = 1. Then E = 3.\nTo find B, cover up x2 on the left and set x = 0.

The area between the curve and the x axis is the definite integral.\nI think of that integral in the following way. The region is made up of thin strips.\nTheir width is dx and their height is v(x). The area of a strip is v(x) times dx. The area of all the strips is 1: v(x) dx. Strictly speaking, the area of one strip is meaningless-genuine rectangles have width Ax. My point is that the picture of thin strips gives the correct approach.\nWe know what function to integrate (from the picture). We also know how (from this course or a calculator). The new applications to volume and length and surface area cut up the region in new ways. Again the small pieces tell the story. In this chapter, what to integrate is more important than how.\n8.1 Areas and Volumes by Slices This section starts with areas between curves. Then it moves to volumes, where the strips become slices. We are weighing a loaf of bread by adding the weights of the slices. The discussion is dominated by examples and figures-the theory is minimal.\nThe real problem is to set up the right integral. At the end we look at a different way of cutting up volumes, into thin shells. All formulas are collected into ajnal table.\nFigure 8.1 shows the area between two curves. The upper curve is the graph of y = v(x). The lower curve is the graph of y = w(x). The strip height is v(x) - w(x), from one curve down to the other. The width is dx (speaking informally again). The total area is the integral of \"top minus bottom\":\narea between two curves =\n[v(x) - w (x)] dx.\n(1) EXAMPLE 1 The upper curve is y = 6x (straight line). The lower curve is y = 3x2\n(parabola).

Start with the pie-shaped wedge in Figure 8.1 b. The area begins at the y axis and ends where the circle meets the line.\nAt the intersection point we have u(x)= w(x):\nfrom\n= x squaring gives 1 - x2 = x2 and then 2x2 = 1.\nThus x2= f . The endpoint is at x = 1/J2. Now integrate the strip height v - w:\nThe area is n/8 (one eighth of the circle). To integrate Jp dx we apply the techniques of Chapter 7: Set x = sin 0, convert to cos20 d0 = f(0 + sin 0 cos O), convert back using 0 = sin-' x. It is harder than expected, for a familiar shape.\nRemark Suppose the problem is to find the whole area between the circle and the line. The figure shows v = w at two points, which are x = 1/$\n(already used) and also x = -I/$.\nInstead of starting at x = 0, which gave $ of a circle, we now include the area to the left.\nMain point: Integrating from x = -I/$ to x = 1 / f i will give the wrong answer.\nIt misses the part of the circle that bulges out over itself, at the far left. In that part, the strips have height 2v instead of v - w. The figure is essential, to get the correct area of this half-circle.\nHORIZONTAL STRIPS INSTEAD OF VERTICAL STRIPS There is more than one way to slice a region. Vertical slices give x integrals.

The regions are threedimensional solids. There are three coordinates x, y, z-and many ways to cut up a solid.\nFigure 8.3 shows one basic way-using slices. The slices have thickness dx, like strips in the plane. Instead of the height y of a strip, we now have the area A of a cross-section. This area is different for different slices: A depends on x. The volume of the slice is its area times its thickness: dV = A(x) dx. The volume of the whole solid is the integral:\nvolume = integral of area times thickness = 1 A(x) dx.\n(2) Note An actual slice does not have the same area on both sides! Its thickness is Ax\n(not dx). Its volume is approximately A(x) Ax (but not exactly). In the limit, the thickness approaches zero and the sum of volumes approaches the integral.\nFor a cylinder all slices are the same.

Tapering the area to zero leaves only f of the volume.\nWhy the f ? Triangles sliced from the pyramid have shorter sides.

The disks are in Figure 8.7b, and their radius is x. This is x = cos-'y in the example. It is x =f -'(y) in general.\nYou have to solve y =f (x) to find x in terms of y. Similarly for shells around the x axis: The length of the shell is x =f -'(y). Integrating may be difficult or impossible.\nWhen y = cos x is rotated around the x axis, here are the choices for volume:\n(good by slices) j n cos2x dx\n(bad by shells) 5 2ny cos -' y dy.\n= COS X Fig. 8.7 Slices through x axis and shells around y axis (good).

A curve y =f (x) is revolved around an axis. That produces a \"surface of revolution,\" which is symmetric around the axis. If we revolve a sloping line, the result is a cone. When the line is parallel to the axis we get a cylinder (a pipe). By revolving a curve we might get a lamp or a lamp shade\n(or even the light bulb).\nSecti.on 8.1 computed the volume inside that surface. This section computes the surface area. Previously we cut the solid into slices or shells. Now we need a good way to cut up the surface.\nThe key idea is to revolve short straight line segments. Their slope is Ay/Ax. They can be the same pieces of length As that were used to find length-now we compute area. When revolved, a straight piece produces a \"thin ban&' (Figure 8.10). The curved surface, from revolving y =f (x), is close to the bands. The first step is to compute the surface area of a band.\nA small comment: Curved surfaces can also be cut into tiny patches.

Not many samples are taken and not many experiments are made. There is a list of possible outcomes, and a known probability for each outcome. But probabilities go far beyond red cards and black cards. The real questions are much more practical:\n1. How often will too many passengers arrive for a flight?\n2. How many random errors do you make on a quiz?\n3. What is the chance of exactly one winner in a big lottery?\nThose are important questions and we will set up models to answer them.\nThere is another point. Discrete models do not involve calculus. The number of errors or bumped passengers or lottery winners is a small whole number. Calculus enters for continuous probability. Instead of results that exactly equal 1 or 2 or 3, calculus deals with results that fall in a range of numbers. Continuous probability comes up in at least two ways:\n(A) An experiment is repeated many times and we take averages.\n(B) The outcome lies anywhere in an interval of numbers.\nIn the continuous case, the probability p, of hitting a particular value x = n becomes zero. Instead we have a probability density p(x)-which is a key idea. The chance that a random X falls between a and b is found by integrating the density p(x):\nRoughly speaking, p(x) dx is the chance of falling between x and x + dx. Certainly p(x) 2 0. If a and b are the extreme limits - co and a,including all possible outcomes, the probability is necessarily one:\nThis is a case where infinite limits of integration are natural and unavoidable. In studying probability they create no difficulty-areas out to infinity are often easier.\nHere are typical questions involving continuous probability and calculus:\n4. How conclusive is a 53%-47% poll of 2500 voters?\n5. Are 16 random football players safe on an elevator with capacity 3600 pounds?\n6. How long before your car is in an accident?\nIt is not so traditional for a calculus course to study these questions. They need extra thought, beyond computing integrals (so this section is harder than average). But probability is more important than some traditional topics, and also more interesting.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 341, "section_id": "s0010-8pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The key idea is to repeat an experiment many times-poll many voters, or toss many dice, or play considerable poker. Each independent experiment produces an outcome X, and the average from N experiments is R. It is called \"X bar\":\n8=XI + X, + ... + X , = average outcome.\nN All we know about p(x) is its mean p and variance a2. It is amazing how much information that gives about the average 8:\nNo matter what the probabilities for X, the probabilities for R move toward the normal bell-shaped curve. The standard deviation is close to a / f i when the experiment is repeated N times. In the Law of Averages, \"almost sure\" means that the chance of R not approaching p is zero. It can happen, but it won't.\nRemark 1 The Boston Globe doesn't understand the Law of Averages. I quote from September 1988: \"What would happen if a giant Red Sox slump arrived? What would happen if the fabled Law of Averages came into play, reversing all those can't miss decisions during the winning streak?\" They think the Law of Averages evens everything up, favoring heads after a series of tails. See Problem 20.\nEXAMPLE 7 Yes-no poll of N = 2500 voters. Is a 53%-47% outcome conclusive?\nThe fraction p of \"yes\" voters in the whole population is not known. That is the reason for the poll. The deviation a = ,/= is also not known, but for one voter this is never more than * (when p = f). Therefore a l p for 2500 voters is no larger than\n+/,/%, which is 1%.\nThe result of the poll was R = 53%. With 95% confidence, this sample is within two standard deviations (here 2%) of its mean. Therefore with 95% confidence, the unknown mean p = p of the whole population is between 51% and 55%. This p~11 is conclusive.\nIf the true mean had been p = 50%, the poll would have had only a ,0013 chance of reaching 53%. The error margin on each side of a poll is amazingly simple; it is always I/*.\nRemark 2 The New York Times has better mathematicians than the Globe. Two days after Bush defeated Dukakis, their poll of N = 11,645 voters was printed with the following explanation. \"In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 [there is 95%] the results should differ by no more than one percentage point [there is 1 / a ] from what would have been obtained by seeking out all voters in the United States.\" EXAMPLE 8 Football players at Caltech (if any) have average weight p = 210 pounds and standard deviation a = 30 pounds.

Each application starts with a finite number of masses or forces. Their sum is the total mass or total force. Then comes the \"continuous case,\" in which the mass is spread out instead of lumped. Its distribution is given by a density function p (Greek rho), and the sum changes to an integral.\nThe first step (hardest step?) is to get the physical quantities straight. The second step is to move from sums to integrals (discrete to continuous, lumped to distributed).\nBy now we hardly stop to think about it-although this is the key idea of integral calculus. The third step is to evaluate the integrals. For that we can use substitution or integration by parts or tables or a computer.\nFigure 8.13 shows the one-dimensional case: masses along the x axis. The total mass is the sum of the masses. The new idea is that of moments-when the mass or force is multiplied by a distance:\nmoment of mass around the y axis = mx = (mass) times (distance to axis).\nFig. 8.13 The center of mass is at 2 =(total moment)/(total mass) =average distance.\nThe figure has masses 1, 3, 2. The total mass is 6. The \"lever arms\" or \"moment arms\" are the distances x = 1, 3,7. The masses have moments 1 and 9 and 14 (since mx is 2 times 7). The total moment is 1 + 9 + 14 = 24. Then the balance point is at 2 = M,/M = 2416 = 4.\nThe total mass is the sum of the m's. The total moment is the sum of m, times x,\n(negative on the other side of x = 0). If the masses are children on a seesaw, the balance point is the center of gravity 2-also called the center of mass:\n- 1m,u, - total moment DEFINITION x=-- E m , totalmass If all masses are moved to 2, the total moment (6 times 4) is still 24. The moment equals the mass C m, times 2. The masses act like a single mass at 2.\nAlso: If we move the axis to 2, and leave the children where they are, the seesaw balances. The masses on the left of 2 = 4 will offset the mass on the right. Reason:\nThe distances to the new axis are x, - 2. The moments add to zero by equation (1):\nmoment around new axis = x m,(xn - 2)= 1m,xn -x m.2 = 0.\nTurn now to the continuous case, when mass is spread out along the line. Each piece of length Ax has an average density p, = (mass of piece)/(length of piece) = AmlAx. As the pieces get shorter, this approaches dmldx-the density at the point.\nThe limit of (small mass)/(small length) is the density p(x).\nIntegrating that derivative p = dmldx, we recover the total mass: C p,Ax becomes total mass M = j p(x) dx.\n(2) When the mass is spread evenly, p is constant. Then M = pL = density times length.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 349, "section_id": "s0010-8pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Dividing by the total mass M gives \"average distance\":\nmoment - My- 5 xp(x) dx center of mass 2 = ---- mass M J p(x) dx '\n(4) Remark If you studied Section 8.4 on probability, you will notice how the formulas match up. The mass I p(x) dx is like the total probability p(x) dx. The moment xp(x) dx is like the mean I xp(x) dx. The moment of inertia (x -~ ) ~ p ( x ) dx is the variance. Mathematics keeps hammering away at the same basic ideas! The only difference is that the total probability is always 1. The mean really corresponds to the center of mass 2, but in probability we didn't notice the division by p(x) dx = 1.\nEXAMPLE 1 With constant density p from 0to L, the mass is M = pL. The moment The center of mass is 2 = My/M= L/2. It is halfway along.\nEXAMPLE 2 With density e-\" the mass is 1, the moment is 1, and 2 is 1:\nI,\" e--\" dx = [-e-\"1,\" = 1 and J,\" xe-\" dx = [-xe-\" - e-\"1,\" = 1.\nMASSES AND MOMENTS IN TWO DIMENSIONS Instead of placing masses along the x axis, suppose m, is at the point (x,, y,) in the plane. Similarly m, is at (x,, y,). Now there are two moments to consider. Around the y axis M,, = C mnxn and around the x axis M, = C m, yn. Please notice that the x's go into the moment My-because the x coordinate gives the distance from the y axis!\nAround the x axis, the distance is y and the moment is M,. The center of mass is the point (2,j)at which everything balances:\nIn the continuous case these sums become two-dimensional integrals. The total mass is JJ p(x, y) dx dy, when the density is p = mass per unit area. These \"double integrals\" are for the future (Section 14.1). Here we consider the most important case:\np = constant. Think of a thin plate, made of material with constant density (say p = 1). To compute its mass and moments, the plate is cut into strips (Figure 8.14):\nmass M = area of plate\n(6) moment My= J (distance x) (length of vertical strip) dx\n(7) moment M, = 5 (height y) (length of horizontal strip) dy.\n(8)", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 350, "section_id": "s0010-8pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The force is multiplied by distance from the turning axis: T = Fx, so a push further out is more effective.\nTo see the physics, replace Newton's law F = ma = m dv/dt by its rotational form:\nT = I dwldt.

The independent variable could be t or x. For velocity it was natural to use the letter t. This section is about two important physical quantities-force and work-for which x is the right choice.\nThe basic formula is W = Fx. Work equals force times distance moved (distance in the direction of F ). With a force of 100 pounds on a car that moves 20 feet, the work is 2000 foot-pounds. If the car is rolling forward and you are pushing backward, the work is -2000 foot-pounds. If your force is only 80 pounds and the car doesn't move, the work is zero. In these examples the force is constant.\nW = Fx is completely parallel to f = vt. When v is constant, we only need multiplication. It is a changing velocity that requires calculus. The integral f v(t) dt adds up small multiplications over short times. For a changing force, we add up small pieces of work F dx over short distances:\nW = Fx (constant force) W = J F(x) dx (changing force).\nIn the first case we lift a suitcase weighing F = 30 pounds up x = 20 feet of stairs.\nThe work is W = 600 foot-pounds. The suitcase doesn't get heavier as we go up-it only seems that way. Actually it gets lighter (we study gravity below).\nIn the second case we stretch a spring, which needs more force as x increases.\nHooke's law says that F(x) = kx. The force is proportional to the stretching distance x.\nStarting from x = 0, the work increases with the square of x:\nF = k x and w = J ; k x d x = : k x 2 .\n(1) In metric units the force is measured in Newtons and the distance in meters. The unit of work is a Newton-meter (a joule). The 600 foot-pounds for an American suitcase would have been about 800 joules in France.\nEXAMPLE 1 Suppose a force of F = 20 pounds stretches a spring 1 foot.\n(a) Find k.\nThe elastic constant is k = Flx = 20 pounds per foot.\n(b) Find W.\nThe work is i k x 2 = i 20 1' = 10 foot-pounds.\n(c) Find x when F = - 10 pounds. This is compression not stretching: x = - foot.\nCompressing the same spring through the same distance requires the same work. For compression x and F are negative. But the work W = f kx2 is still positive. Please note that W does not equal kx times x! That is the whole point of variable force\n(change Fx to 5 F(x) dx).\nMay I add another important quantity from physics? It comes from looking at the situation from the viewpoint of the spring. In its natural position, the spring rests comfortably. It feels no strain and has no energy. Tension or compression gives it potential energy. More stretching or more compression means more energy. The change in energy equals the work. The potential energy of the suitcase increases by 600 foot-pounds, when it is lifted 20 feet.\nWrite V(x) for the potential energy. Here x is the height of the suitcase or the extension of the spring. In moving from x = a to x = b, work = increase in potential:\nThis is absolutely beautiful. The work W is the definite integral.

We may feel tired, but the trip down should have given back our energy.\n(It was in the suitcase.) Starting with a spring that is compressed one foot, and ending with the spring extended one foot, again we have done no work. V =fkx2 is the same for x = -1 and x = 1. But an extension from x = 1 to x = 3 requires work:\nW = change in V = 3k(3)2-3k(1)2.\nIndefinite integrals like V come with a property that we know well. They include an arbitrary constant C. The correct potential is not simply $kx2, it is ikx2 + C. To compute a change in potential, we don't need C. The constant cancels. But to determine V itself, we have to choose C. By fixing V = 0 at one point, the potential is determined at all other points. A common choice is V= 0 at x = 0. Sometimes V= 0 at x = oo (for gravity). Electric fields can be \"grounded\" at any point.\nThere is another connection between the potential V and the force F. According to (2), V is the indefinite integral of F. Therefore F(x) is the derivative of V(x). The fundamental theorem of calculus is also fundamental to physics:\nforce exerted on spring: F = dV/dx\n(34 force exerted by spring: F = - dV/dx\n(3b) Those lines say the same thing. One is our force pulling on the spring, the other is the \"restoring force\" pulling back. (3a) and (3b) are a warning that the sign of F depends on the point of view. Electrical engineers and physicists use the minus sign.\nIn mechanics the plus sign is more common. It is one of the ironies of fate that F = V', while distance and velocity have those letters reversed: v =f '.

Suppose you release the spring or drop the suitcase. The external force changes to F = 0. But the internal force still acts on the spring, and gravity still acts on the suitcase.

The water has weightdensity w % 9800 N/m3 - 62 lb/ft3 . On the base, the pressure is w times h.

We divide the side into horizontal strips of thickness Ah. Geometry gives the length 1(h) at depth h\n(Figure 8.17). The area of a strip is 1(h) Ah.

But if you were a flight controller, and a plane appeared on the screen, you would not give its position that way. Instead of x and y, you would read off the direction of the plane and its distance. The direction is given by an angle 6. The distance is given by a positive number r. Those are the polar coordinates of the point, where x and y are the rectangular coordinates.\nThe angle 6 is measured from the horizontal. Suppose the distance is 2 and the direction is 30\"or 4 6 (degrees preferred by flight controllers, radians by mathematicians). A pilot looking along the x axis would give the plane's direction as \"11 o'clock.\" This totally destroys our system of units, by measuring direction in hours.\nBut the angle and the distance locate the plane.\nHow far to a landing strip at r = 1 and 8 = - n/2? For that question polar coordinates are not good. They are perfect for distance from the origin (which equals r), but for most other distances I would switch to x and y. It is extremely simple to determine x and y from r and 8, and we will do it constantly. The most used formulas in this chapter come from Figure 9.1-where the right triangle has angle 6 and hypotenuse r.

That is a relation between the polar coordinates, and the points satisfying an equation like r = cos 8 produce a polar graph.\nIt is not obvious why r = cos 8 gives a circle. The equations r = cos 28 and r = cos28 and r = 1 + cos 8 produce entirely different graphs-not circles.

The parameter 0 is the angle, but it could be the time-the curve would be the same. Chapter 12 studies parametric equations in detail-here we stay with the circle.\nTo find the circle, square x and y and add. This produces x2 + y2 = x in Problem 26.\nBut here we do something new: Start with the circle andfind equation (4).In case you don't reach Chapter 12, the idea is this. Add the vectors OC to the center and CP out the radius:\nThe point P in Figure 9.2 has (x, y) = OC + CP = (f,0) + (f cos t, f sin t).\nThe parameter t is the angle at the center of the circle. The equations are x = f + f cos t and y = sin t. A trigonometric person sees a double angle and sets t = 28. The result is equation (4) for the circle:\nx = f + f cos 28 = cos28 and y = f sin 28 = sin 8 cos 8.\n(5) This step rediscovers a basic theorem of geometry: The angle t at the center is twice the angle 0 at the circumference.

The angle 8 does not even appear. The equation looks too easy, but that is the point! The graph is a circle around the origin (the unit circle). Compare with the line x = 1.

The cardioid is a sentimental favoritemaybe parabolas are more practical. The cardioid is r = 1+ cos 8, the parabola is r = 1/(1+ cos 8). Section 12.2 adds cycloids and astroids. A graphics package can draw them and so can we.\nTogether with the circles r = constant go the straight lines 8 = constant. The equation 8 = n/4is a ray out from the origin, at that fixed angle. If we allow r < 0, as we do in drawing graphs, the one-directional ray changes to a full line. Important: The circles are perpendicular to the rays. We have \"orthogonal coordinates\"-more interesting than the x - y grid of perpendicular lines. In principle x could be mixed with 8 (non-orthogonal), but in practice that never happens.\nOther curves are attractive in polar coordinates-we look first at five examples.\nSometimes we switch back to x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8, to recognize the graph.\nEXAMPLE 1 The graph of r = l/cos 8 is the straight line x = 1 (because r cos 8 = 1).\nEXAMPLE 2 The graph of r = cos 28 is the four-petalflower in Figure 9.3.\nThe points at 8 = 30\" and -30\" and 150\" and -150\" are marked on the flower. They all have r = cos 28 = 9. There are three important symmetries-across the x axis, across the y axis, and through the origin. This four-petal curve has them all. So does the vertical flower r = sin 28-but surprisingly, the tests it passes are different.\n(Across the x axis: y to -y) There are two ways to cross. First, change 8 to -8.\nThe equation r = cos 28 stays the same. Second, change 8 to n - 8 and also r to -r.\nThe equation r = sin 28 stays the same. Both flowers have x axis symmetry.\n(Across the y axis: x to -x) There are two ways to cross. First, change 8 to n - 8.\nThe equation r = cos 28 stays the same. Second, change 8 to -8 and r to -r. Now r = sin 28 stays the same (the sine is odd). Both curves have y axis symmetry.\n(Through the origin) Now we change r to -r or 8 to 8 + n. The flower equations pass the second test only: cos 2(8 + n ) = cos 28 and sin 2(8 + n)= sin 28. Every equation r2 = F(8) passes the first test, since (- r)2= r2.\nThe circle r = cos 8 has x axis symmetry, but not y or r. The spiral r = 8' has y axis symmetry, because -r = (- Q3 is the same equation.\nQuestion What happens if you change r to -r and also change 8 to 8 + n?\nAnswer Nothing-because\n(r, 8) and (- r, 8 + n)are always the same point.\nFig. 9.3 The four-petal flower r =cos 28 and the spiral r = 8 (r > 0 in red).", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 366, "section_id": "s0011-9pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Our other examples are\n\"periodic\"--8\n= 271 gives the same point as 8 = 0. A periodic curve repeats itself. The spiral moves out by 271 each time it comes around. If we allow negative angles and negative r = 8, a second spiral appears.\nEXAMPLE 4 The graph of r = 1 + cos 8 is a cardioid. It is drawn in Figure 9.4~.\nThe cardioid has no simple xy equation. Still the curve is very attractive. It has a cusp at the origin and it is heart-shaped (hence its name). To draw it, plot r = 1 + cos 8 at 30\" intervals and connect the points. For this curve r is never negative, since cos 8 never goes below -1.\nIt is a curious fact that the electrical vector in your heart almost traces out a cardioid. See Section 11.1 about electrocardiograms.

(I am only referring to the shell. Excusez-moi!) Figure 9.4 shows how a dimple appears as b increases. Then an inner loop appears beyond b = 1 (the cardioid at b = 1 is giving birth to a loop). For large b the curve looks more like two circles.\nThe limiting case is a double circle, when the inner loop is the same as the outer loop. Remember that r = cos 8 goes around the circle twice.\nWe could magnify the limaqon by a factor c, changing to r = c(l + b cos 8). We could rotate 180\" to r = 1 - b cos 8. But the real interest is whether these figures arise in applications, and Donald Saari showed me a nice example.\nMars seen from Earth The Earth goes around the Sun and so does Mars. Roughly speaking Mars is 14 times as far out, and completes its orbit in two Earth years.\nWe take the orbits as circles: r = 2 for Earth and r = 3 for Mars. Those equations tell where but not when.

When we move the origin to that point, the 2 is subtracted awaythe M -E coordinates become x = r cos nt and y = r sin nt with r = 3 - 4 cos nt. That is a limacon with a loop, like Figure 9.4d.\nNote added in proof I didn't realize that a 3-to-2 ratio is also responsible for heating up two spots on opposite sides of Mercury. From the newspaper of June 13, 1990:\n\"Astronomers today reported the first observations showing that Mercury has two extremely hot spots. That is because Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, turns on its axis once every 59.6 days, which is a day on Mercury. It goes around the sun every 88 days, a Mercurian year. With this 3-to-2 ratio between spin and revolution, the Sun appears to stop in the sky and move backward, describing a loop over each of the hot spots.\" CONIC SECTIONS IN POLAR COORDINATES The exercises include other polar curves, like lemniscates and 200-petal flowers. But get serious. The most important curves are the ellipse and parabola and hyperbola.\nIn Section 3.5 their equations involved 1, x, y, x2, xy, y2. With one focus at the origin, their polar equations are even better.\n9A The graph of r = A/(1+ e cos 0) is a conic section with \"eccentricity\" e:\nEXAMPLE 6 (e = 1) The graph of r = 1/(1+ cos 8) is a parabola. This equation is r + r cos 8 = 1 or r = 1 - x. Squaring both sides gives x2 + y2 = 1 - 2x + x2. Canceling x2 leaves Y2 = 1 - 2x, the parabola in Figure 9.5b.\nThe amplifying factor A blows up all curves, with no change in shape.\nEXAMPLE 7\n(e = 2) The same steps lead from r(1 + 2 cos 8) = 1 to r = 1 - 2x. Squaring gives x2 + y2 = 1 - 4x + 4x2 and the x2 terms do not cancel. Instead we have y2 - 3x2= 1 - 4x. This is the hyperbola in Figure 9Sc, with a focus at (0,O).\nThe hyperbola y2 - 3x2 = 1 (without the -4x) has its center at (0,O).\nEXAMPLE 8 (e = 4) The same steps lead from r(1 + 4 cos 8) = 1 to r = 1 -4x. Squaring gives the ellipse x2 + y2 = 1 - x + ax2. Polar equations look at conics in a new way, which happens to match the sun and planets perfectly. The sun at (0,O) is not the center of the system, but a focus.\nFinally e = 0 gives the circle r = 1.

There was no calculus! We now tackle the problems of area (integral calculus) and slope (differential calculus), when the equation is r = F(8).

Starting from x2 + 4, its integral 3x3 + 4x + C is also real. If we are given x3 - 1, its derivative 3x2 is real. But the roots (or zeros) of those polynomials are complex numbers:\nx2 + 4 = 0 and\n.u3 - 1 = 0 have complex solutions.\nWe expect two square roots of - 4. There are three cube roots of 1. Complex numbers are unavoidable, in order to find n roots for each polynomial of degree n.\nThis section explains how to work with complex numbers. You will see their relation to polar coordinates. At the end, we use them to solve differential equations.\nStart with the imaginary number i. Everybody knows that x2 = - 1 has no real solution. When you square a real number, the result is never negative. So the world has agreed on a solution called i. (Except that electrical engineers call it j.) Imaginary numbers follow the normal rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with one difference: Whenever i2 appears it is replaced by - 1 . In particular - i times\n- i gives + i2 = - 1. In other words, - i is also a square root of - 1 . There are two solutions (i and - i) to the equation x2 + 1 = 0.\nFinding cube roots of 1 will stretch us further. We need complex numbers-real plus imaginary.\n9B A complex number (say 1 + 3i) is the sum of a real number (1) and a pure imaginary number (39. Addition keeps those parts separate; multiplication uses i2 = - 1:\nAddition: (1 + 3i) + (1 + 3i) = 1 + 1 + i(3 + 3) = 2 + 6i Multiplication:\n(1 + 3i)(1 + 3i) = 1 + 3i + 3i + 9i2 = - 8 + 6i.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 374, "section_id": "s0011-9pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Similarly x + iy is paired with (x, y)-which is x units along the \"real axis\" and y units up the \"imaginary axis.\" The ordinary plane turns into the complex plane. The absolute value r is the same as the polar coordinate r (Figure 9.8~).\nThe figure shows two more copies of the complex plane. The one in the middle is for addition and subtraction. It uses rectangular coordinates. The one on the right is for multiplication and division and squaring. It uses polar coordinates.

The vector sum (2,2) corresponds to the complex sum 2 + 2i. The complex conjugate 3 - i is the mirror image across the real axis (i reversed to -i). The connection to r and 8 is the same as before (you see it in the triangle):\nx = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8 so that x + iy = r(cos 8 + i sin 8).\n(2) In the third figure, 1 + i has r = fi and 8 = n/4.

Compare that series with this one, which also equals a:\nThat alternating series is really remarkable. It is typical of this chapter, because its pattern is clear. We know the 2 billionth term (it has a minus sign). This is not a geometric series, but in Section 10.1 it comes from a geometric series.\nQuestion Does this series actually converge? What if all signs are + ?\nAnswer The alternating series converges to a (Section 10.3). The positive series diverges to infinity (Section 10.2).The terms go to zero, but their sum is infinite.\nThis example begins to show what the chapter is about. Part of the subject deals with special series, adding to 1019 or n: or ex. The other part is about series in general, adding to numbers or functions that nobody has heard of. The situation was the same for integrals-they give famous answers like In x or unknown answers like 1xX dx. The sum of 1 + 118 + 1/27 + is also unknown-although a lot of mathematicians have tried.\nThe chapter is not long, but it is full. The last half studies power series. We begin with a linear approximation like 1 + x. Next is a quadratic approximation like 1 + x + x2. In the end we match all the derivatives of f(x). This is the \"Taylor series,\" a new way to create functions-not by formulas or integrals but by infinite series.\nNo example can be better than 1/(1 - x), which dominates Section 10.1. Then we define convergence and test for it. (Most tests are really comparisons with a geometric series.) The second most important series in mathematics is the exponential series eX = 1 + x +$x2 +&x3+ ---.It includes the series for sin x and cos x, because of the formula eix= cos x + i sin x. Finally a whole range of new and old functions will come from Taylor series.\nIn the end, all the key functions of calculus appear as ''infinite polynomials\" (except the step function).

Its derivatives at x = 0 are zero, except the nth derivative, which is n!

To get familiar with other series, we now apply algebra or calculus- to reach the square of 1/(1 - x) or its derivative or its integral. The point is that these operations are applied to the series.\nThe best I know is to show you eight operations that produce something useful.\nAt the end we discover series for In 2 and n.\n1. Multiply the geometric series by a or ax:\nThe first series fits the decimal 3.333 . . . . In that case a = 3.

Multiply series: the geometric series times itselfis 1/(1 - x) squared:\nThe series on the right is not new! In equation (5) it was the derivative of y = 1/(1- x).\nNow it is the square of the same y. The geometric series satisfies dyldx = y2, so the function does too. We have stumbled onto a differential equation.\nNotice how the series was squared. A typical term in equation (8) is 3x2, coming from 1 times x2 and x times x and x2 times 1 on the left side. It is a lot quicker to square 1/(1 - x)-but other series can be multiplied when we don't know what functions they add up to.\n5. Solve dyldx = y2 fvom any starting value-a new application of series:\nSuppose the starting value is y = 1 at x = 0. The equation y' = y 2 gives l2 for the derivative. Now a key step: The derivative of the equation gives y\" = 2yy'. At x = 0 that is 2 1 1. Continuing upwards, the derivative of 2yy1 is 2yy\" + 2(y')2. At x = 0 that is y\"' = 4 + 2 = 6.\nAll derivatives are factorials: 1,2,6,24, . . . . We are matching the derivatives of the geometric series 1 + x + x2 + x3 + . . . . Term by term, we rediscover the solution to y' = Y2. The solution starting from y(0) = 1 is y = 1/(1 - x).\nA different starting value is - 1. Then y' = (-\n= 1 as before. The chain rule gives y\" = 2yy' = - 2 and then y\"' = 6. With alternating signs to match these derivatives, the solution starting from - 1 is It is a small challenge to recognize the function on the right from the series on the left. The series has - x in place of x; then multiply by -1. The sum y = - 1/(1 + x) also satisfies y' = y2. We can solve diferential equations from all starting values by inJinite series. Essentially we substitute an unknown series into the equation, and calculate one term at a time.\n6.

This harmonic series 1 + 4 + 4+ came into the earliest discussion of limits (Section 2.6). The second series has alternating signs and converges to In 2. The third has plus signs and also converges to In 2. These will be examples for a major topic in infinite series-tests for convergence.\nFor the first time in this book we are able to compute a logarithm! Something remarkable is involved. The sums of numbers in (11) and (12) were discoveredfrom the sums offunctions in (10). You might think it would be easier to deal only with numbers, to compute In 2. But then we would never have integrated the series for 1/(1- x) and detected (10). It is better to work with x, and substitute special values like 4at the end.\nThere are two practical problems with these series. For In 2 they converge slowly.\nFor In e they blow up. The correct answer is In e = 1, but the series can't find it. Both problems are solved by adding (10a) to (lob), which cancels the even powers:\nAt x = f,the right side is in 4 - In 4 = In 2.

Variations of his method (polygons in circles) reached as far as 34 digits-but not for 1800 years. Then Halley found 71 digits of 7116 with equation (18). For faster convergence that series was replaced by other inverse tangents, using smaller values of x:\nA prodigy named Dase, who could multiply 100-digit numbers in his head in 8 hours, finally passed 200 digits of n. The climax of hand calculation came when Shanks published 607 digits. I am sorry to say that only 527 were correct. (With years of calculation he went on to 707 digits, but still only 527 were correct.) The mistake was not noticed until 1945! Then Ferguson reached 808 digits with a desk calculator.\nNow comes the computer. Three days on an ENIAC (1949) gave 2000 digits. A hundred minutes on an IBM 704 (1958) gave 10,000 digits. Shanks (no relation) reached 100,000 digits. Finally a million digits were found in a day in 1973, with a CDC 7600. All these calculations used variations of equation (20).\nThe record after that went between Cray and Hitachi and now IBM. But the method changed. The calculations rely on an incredibly accurate algorithm, based on the \"arithmetic-geometric mean iteration\" of Gauss. It is also incredibly simple, all things considered:\nThe number of correct digits more than doubles at every step. By n = 9 we are far beyond Shanks (the hand calculator). No end is in sight. Almost anyone can go past a billion digits, since with the Chudnovsky method we don't have to start over again.\nIt is time to stop. You may think (or hope) that nothing more could possibly be done with geometric series. We have gone a long way from 1/(1- x), but some functions can never be reached. One is ex (and its relatives sin x, cos x, sinh x, cosh x).\nAnother is JG(and its relatives I/,/-, sin- 'x, sec- 'x, . . .). The exponentials are in 10.4, with series that converge for all x. The square-roots are in 10.5, closer to geometric series and converging for 1x1 < 1. Before that we have to say what convergence means.\nThe series came fast, but I hope you see what can be done (subtract, multiply, differentiate, integrate). Addition is easy, division is harder, all are legal. Some unexpected numbers are the sums of infinite series.\nAdded in proof By e-mail I just learned that the record for TC is back in Japan:\n230 digits which is more than 1.07 billion.

I Proof Suppose s, approaches s (as required by convergence). Then also s,-, approaches s, and the difference s, - s, -,approaches zero. That difference is a,. So a, -+ 0.\nEXAMPLE 1 (continued) For the geometric series 1 + x + x2 + . a - , the test an+0 is the same as xn -+ 0. The test is failed if 1x1 2 1, because the powers of x don't go to zero. Automatically the series diverges. The test is passed if -1 < x < 1. But to prove convergence, we cannot rely on a, -+ 0. It is the partial sums that must converge:\n1 - xn s, = 1+ x + .., + x\"-' = - and sn -+ - 1 .\nThis is s.\n1 - x 1 - x For other series, first check that a, -,0 (otherwise there is no chance of convergence). The a, will not have the special form xn-so we need sharper tests.\nThe geometric series stays in our mind for this reason. Many convergence tests are comparisons with that series. The right comparison gives enough information:\nIf la,/ <iand la2[<+and ..., then a, +a2 + ... converges faster than f + $ + ....\nMore generally, the terms in a, + a2 + a3 + ... may be smaller than ax + ax2 + ax3 + + . .. Provided x < 1, the second series converges. Then an also converges. We move now to convergence by comparison or divergence by comparison.\nThroughout the rest of this section, all numbers a, are assumed positive.\nCOMPARISON TEST AND INTEGRAL TEST In practice it is rare to compute the partial sums s, = a, + + a,. Usually a simple formula can't be found. We may never know the exact limit s. But it is still possible to decide convergence- whether there is a sum- by comparison with another series that is known to converge.\n100 (Comparison test) Suppose that 0 <a, 4b. and 1b, converges. Then I I zanconverges.\nThe smaller terms an add to a smaller sum: 1an is below 1bn and must converge.\nOn the other hand suppose an 2 cn and cn= co.This comparison forces 1an= m.\nA series diverges if it is above another divergent series.\nNote that a series of positive terms can only diverge \"to infinity.\" It cannot oscillate, because each term moves it forward. Either the s, creep up on s, passing every number below it, or they pass all numbers and diverge. If an increasing sequence s, is bounded above, it must converge.

The harmonic series, above it, must also diverge.\nTo apply the comparison test, we need something to compare with. In Example 2, we thought of another series. It was convenient because of those 3's. But a different series will need a different comparison, and where will it come from? There is an automatic way to think of a comparison series. It comes from the integral test.\nAllow me to apply the integral test to the same example. To understand the integral test, look at the areas in Figure 10.2. The test compares rectangles with curved areas.\ny (s)= - 1 y (x) = 1 sum + oo so Fig. 10.2 Integral test: Sums and integrals both diverge (p = 1) and both converge (p > 1).\nEXAMPLE 2 (again) Compare 1 +3+ 4+ . . . with the area under the curve y = 1/x.\nEvery term a, = lln is the area of a rectangle. We are comparing it with a curved area c,. Both areas are between x = n and x = n + 1, and the rectangle is above the curve. SO a, > c,:\n1 rectangular area a, = - exceeds curved area c, = n Here is the point. Those c,'s look complicated, but we can add them up. The sum c, + ... + c, is the whole area, from 1 to n + 1. It equals ln(n + 1)-we know the integral of llx. We also know that the logarithm goes to infinity.\nThe rectangular area 1 + 112 + ... + lln is above the curved area. By comparison of areas, the harmonic series diverges to infinity-a little faster than ln(n + 1).\nRemark The integral of l/x has another advantage over the series with 3's. First, the integral test was automatic. From l/n in the series, we went to l/x in the integral.\nSecond, the comparison is closer. Instead of adding only $ when the number of terms is doubled, the true partial sums grow like In n. To prove that, put rectangles under the curve.\nRectangles below the curve give an area below the integral. Figure 10.2b omits the first rectangle, to get under the curve. Then we have the opposite to the first comparison-the sum is now smaller than the integral:\nAdding 1 to both sides, s, is below 1 + In n. From the previous test, s, is above ln(n + 1). That is a narrow space-we have an excellent estimate of s,. The sum of lln", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 391, "section_id": "s0012-10pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

We are using integrals to help with sums (it used to be the opposite).\nQuestion If a computer adds a million terms every second for a million years, how large is the partial sum of the harmonic series?\nAnswer The number of terms is n = 602 * 24 * 365 \" 1012 < 3.2 - 1019. Therefore In n is less than In 3.2 + 19 In 10 < 45.

Also y(x) must be decreasing. Then a rectangle of height an is above the graph to the right of x = n, and below the graph to the left of x = n. The series and the integral box each other in: left sum > integral > right sum. The reasoning is the same as it was for a, = 1/n and y(x) = llx: There is finite area in the rectangles when there is finite area under the curve.\nWhen we can't add the a's, we integrate y(x) and compare areas:\n10C\n(Integral test) If y(x) is decreasing and y(n) agrees with an, then a, + a2 + a3 + --- and y(x) dx both converge or both diverge.\n1 1 1 1 EXAMPLE 3 The \"p-series\" -+ -+\n+\n--+ converges if p > 1.

By the comparison test, every p < 1 also produces divergence. Thus 11/ n diverges by comparison with Sdxl/x (and also by comparison with l1/n). Section 7.5 on improper integrals runs parallel to this section on \"improper sums\" (infinite series).\nNotice the special cases p = 2 and p = 3. The series 1 + 1 +\n-\n+ ... converges. Euler found it2/6 as its sum. The series 1 + + -L + \"' also converges. That is proved by comparing Z1/n3 with 11/n 2 or with 5 dx/x3 . But the sum for p = 3 is unknown.\nExtra credit problem The sum of the p-series leads to the most important problem in pure mathematics. The \"zeta function\" is Z(p) = I1/n P, so Z(2) = ir2/6 and Z(3) is unknown. Riemann studied the complex numbers p where Z(p) = 0 (there are infinitely many). He conjectured that the real part of those p is always ½. That has been tested for the first billion zeros, but never proved.\nCOMPARISON WITH THE GEOMETRIC SERIES We can compare any new series aI + a2 + ... with 1 + x + --. Remember that the first million terms have nothing to do with convergence. It is further out, as n - oo, that the comparison stands or falls.

For any divergent (or convergent) series, there is another that diverges (or converges) more slowly.\nThus there is no hope of an ultimate all-purpose comparison test. But comparison is the best method available. Every series in that line can be compared with its neighbors, and other series can be placed in between.

More exactly, the order of terms is important when the series are conditionally convergent.\nFor absolutely convergent series, the order makes no difference. We can rearrange their terms and multiply them in any order, and the sum and product comes out right:\nRather than proving 101 and 10J, we show what happens when there is only conditional convergence.

Second, the function must do what the series predicts, away from x = 0. Those are true for ex and cos x and sin x; the series equals the function. We proceed on that basis.\nThe Taylor series with special basepoint x = 0 is also called the \"Maclaurin series.\" EXAMPLE 3 Find the Taylor series for f(x) = sin x around x = 0.\nSolution The numbers f(\")(0) are the values of f= sin x, f' = cos x, f\" = - sin x,...\nat x = 0.

But Taylor series can be constructed around other points x = a. The principle is the same-match derivatives by powers-but now the powers to use are (x - a)\". The derivatives f(\"'(a) are computed at the new basepoint x = a.\nThe Taylor series begins with f(a) + f'(a)(x - a). This is the tangent approximation at x = a.

Therefore the Taylor series has that constant factor (note the powers of x - 1, not x):\nDEFINING THE FUNCTION BY ITS SERIES Usually, we define sin x and cos x from the sides of a triangle. But we could start instead with the series. Define sin x by equation (2). The logic goes backward, but it is still correct:\nFirst, prove that the series converges.\nSecond, prove properties like (sin x)' = cos x.\nThird, connect the definitions by series to the sides of a triangle.\nWe don't plan to do all this. The usual definition was good enough. But note first:\nThere is no problem with convergence. The series for sin x and cos x and ex all have terms fxn/n!. The factorials make the series converge for all x. The general rule for ex times eYcan be based on the series. Equation (6) is typical: e is multiplied by powers of (x - 1). Those powers add to ex-'. So the series proves that ex = eex-'.\nThat is just one example of the multiplication (ex)(eY) = ex+Y:\nTerm by term, multiplication gives the series for ex+Y. Term by term, differentiating the series for ex gives ex. Term by term, the derivative of sin x is cos x:\nWe don't need the famous limit (sin x)/x -,1, by which geometry gave us the derivative.

That is a \"Fourier sine series\", which treats all x's equally instead of picking on a basepoint.\nA Fourier series allows jumps and corners in the graph-it takes the rough with the smooth. By contrast a power series is terrific near its basepoint, and gets worse as you move away. The Taylor coefficients an are totally determined at the basepoint-where all derivatives are computed. Remember the rule for Taylor series:\nan = (nth derivative at the basepoint)/n! =f(\")(a)/n!\n(1) A remarkable fact is the convergence in a symmetric interval around x = a.\n40M A power series Zax\" either converges for all x, or it converges only at the basepoint x =0, or else it has a radius of convergence r:\nYlax\" converges absolutely if lxl\n< r and diverges if xi > r.\nThe series Ix\"/n! converges for all x (the sum is ex). The series In!x\" converges for no x (except x = 0). The geometric series Ex\" converges absolutely for Ixl < 1 and diverges for Ixl\n> 1. Its radius of convergence is r = 1. Note that its sum 1/(1 - x) is perfectly good for Ix > 1-the function is all right but the series has given up. If something goes wrong at the distance r, a power series can't get past that point.\nWhen the basepoint is x = a, the interval of convergence shifts over to Ix - al < r.\nThe series converges for x between a - r and a + r (symmetric around a). We cannot say in advance whether the endpoints a + r give divergence or convergence (absolute or conditional). Inside the interval, an easy comparison test will now prove convergence.\nPROOF OF 10M Suppose Ya,X\" converges at a particular point X. The proof will show that Ia,x\" converges when Ixi is less than the number IXI. Thus convergence at X gives convergence at all closer points x (I mean closer to the basepoint 0). Proof:\nSince I anX\" converges, its terms approach zero. Eventually lanX\"I < 1 and then Iaxnl = IaX\"I Ix/lX < Ix/XI\".\nOur series I a,x\" is absolutely convergent by comparison with the geometric series for Ix/XI, which converges since Ix/XI < 1.\nEXAMPLE 1 The series Inx\"/4\" has radius of convergence r = 4.\nThe ratio test and root test are best for power series. The ratios between terms approach x/4 (and so does the nth root of nx\"/4\"):\n(n + 1)x\"+' Inx\" x n + 1 x 4n+1\n/4 -= 4 n approaches L = 4 The ratio test gives convergence if L < 1, which means Ixl < 4.\n391", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 406, "section_id": "s0012-10pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

There is absolute convergence if Ix - 51 < 1. This is the interval 4 < x < 6, symmetric around the basepoint. This series happens to converge at the endpoints 4 and 6, because of the factor 1/n2. That factor decides the delicate question-convergence at the endpoints-but all powers of n give the same interval of convergence 4 < x < 6.\nCONVERGENCE TO THE FUNCTION: REMAINDER TERM AND RADIUS r Remember that a Taylor series starts with a function f(x). The derivatives at the basepoint produce the series. Suppose the series converges: Does it converge to the function? This is a question about the remainder R,(x) =f(x) - sn(x), which is the difference between f and the partial sum s, = ao + \" + an(x - a)\". The remainder Rn is the error if we stop the series, ending with the nth derivative term a,(x - a)\".\n10N Suppose f has an (n + 1)st derivative from the basepoint a out to x. Then for some point c in between (position not known) the remainder at x equals R,(x) = f(x) - s,(x) = f(\"+ 1)(c)(x - a)\" + '/(n + 1)!\n(2) The error in stopping at the nth derivative is controlled by the (n + 1)st derivative.\nYou will guess, correctly, that the unknown point c comes from the Mean Value Theorem. For n = 1 the proof is at the end of Section 3.8. That was the error e(x) in linear approximation:\nR1(x) = f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a) = f \"(c)(x - a)2.\nFor every n, the proof compares Rn with (x - a)\" +1. Their (n + 1)st derivatives are f(n+ ') and (n + 1)! The generalized Mean Value Theorem says that the ratio of R, to\n(x - a)\" + equals the ratio of those derivatives, at the right point c. That is equation\n(2). The details can stay in Section 3.8 and Problem 23, because the main point is what we want. The error is exactly like the next term a,\n+ (x - a)\" +1, except that the\n(n + 1)st derivative is at c instead of the basepoint a.\nEXAMPLE 4 Whenf is ex, the (n + 1)st derivative is ex. Therefore the error is Rn=ex - 1 +x+ ... + -\n= ec\n(3)\n\" n! = (n + 1)!* At x = 1 and n = 2, the error is e - (1 + 1 + )\n.218. The right side is ec/6. The unknown point is c = In (.218 - 6) = .27. Thus c lies between the basepoint a = 0 and the error point x = 1, as required. The series converges to the function, because R, - 0.\nIn practice, n is the number of derivatives to be calculated. We may aim for an error IRn, below 10- 6. Unfortunately, the high derivative in formula (2) is awkward to estimate (except for ex). And high derivatives in formula (1) are difficult to compute.\nMost real calculations use only afew terms of a Taylor series. For more accuracy we move the basepoint closer, or switch to another series.\n392", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 407, "section_id": "s0012-10pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

It is multidimensional calculus, because the subject moves into more dimensions. In the first ten chapters, all functions depended on time t or position x-but not both. We had f(t) or y(x). The graphs were curves in a plane. There was one independent variable (x or t) and one dependent variable (y or f). Now we meet functions f(x, t) that depend on both x and t. Their graphs are surfaces instead of curves. This brings us to the calculus of several variables.\nStart with the surface that represents the function f(x, t) or f(x, y) or f(x, y,,t). I emphasize functions, because that is what calculus is about.\nEXAMPLE 1 f(x, t) = cos (x - t) is a traveling wave (cosine curve in motion).\nAt t = 0 the curve is f = cos x. At a later time, the curve moves to the right\n(Figure 11.1). At each t we get a cross-section of the whole x-t surface. For a wave traveling along a string, the height depends on position as well as time.\nA similar function gives a wave going around a stadium. Each person stands up and sits down. Somehow the wave travels.\nEXAMPLE 2 f(x, y) = 3x + y + 1 is a sloping roof (fixed in time).\nThe surface is two-dimensional-you can walk around on it. It is flat because 3x + y + 1 is a linear function. In the y direction the surface goes up at 45\". If y increases by 1, so does f. That slope is 1. In the x direction the roof is steeper (slope 3).\nThere is a direction in between where the roof is steepest (slope fi).\nEXAMPLE 3 f(x, y, t) = cos(x -y - t) is an ocean surface with traveling waves.\nThis surface moves. At each time t we have a new x-y surface. There are three variables, x and y for position and t for time. I can't draw the function, it needs four dimensions! The base coordinates are x, y, t and the height is f.The alternative is a movie that shows the x-y surface changing with t.\nAt time t = 0 the ocean surface is given by cos (x - y). The waves are in straight lines. The line x - y = 0follows a crest because cos 0= 1. The top of the next wave is on the parallel line x -y = 2n, because cos 2n = 1. Figure 11.1 shows the ocean surface at a fixed time.\nThe line x -y = t gives the crest at time t. The water goes up and down (like people in a stadium). The wave goes to shore, but the water stays in the ocean.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 413, "section_id": "s0013-11pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

In business, demand is a function of price and date. In engineering, the velocity and temperature depend on position x and time t. Biology deals with many variables at once (and statistics is always looking for linear relations like z = x + 2y). A serious job lies ahead, to carry derivatives and integrals into more dimensions.\nIn a plane, every point is described by two numbers. We measure across by x and up by y. Starting from the origin we reach the point with coordinates (x, y). I want to describe this movement by a vector-the straight line that starts at (0,O) and ends at (x, y). This vector v has a direction, which goes from (0,O) to (x, y) and not the other way.\nIn a picture, the vector is shown by an arrow. In algebra, v is given by its two components.

To add the vectors, add the components. To draw this addition, place the start of w at the end of v. Figure 11.3 shows how w starts where v ends.\nVECTORS WITHOUT COORDINATES In that head-to-tail addition of v + w, we did something new. The vector w was moved away from the origin. Its length and direction were not changed! The new arrow is parallel to the old arrow-only the starting point is different. The vector is the same as before.\nA vector can be defined without an origin and without x and y axes. The purpose of axes is to give the components-the separate distances x and y. Those numbers are necessary for calculations. But x and y coordinates are not necessary for headto-tail addition v + w, or for stretching to 2v, or for linear combinations 2v + 3w.\nSome applications depend on coordinates, others don't.\nGenerally speaking, physics works without axes-it is \"coordinate-free.\" A velocity has direction and magnitude, but it is not tied to a point. A force also has direction and magnitude, but it can act anywhere-not only at the origin. In contrast, a vector that gives the prices of five stocks is not floating in space. Each component has a meaning-there are five axes, and we know when prices are zero. After examples from geometry and physics (no axes), we return to vectors with coordinates.\nEXAMPLE 1 (Geometry) Take any four-sided figure in space. Connect the midpoints of the four straight sides. Remarkable fact: Those four midpoints lie in the same plane.\nMore than that, they form a parallelogram.\nFrankly, this is amazing. Figure 1 1.4a cannot do justice to the problem, because it is printed on a flat page. Imagine the vectors A and D coming upward. B and C go down at different angles. Notice how easily we indicate the four sides as vectors, not caring about axes or origin.\nI will prove that V = W. That shows that the midpoints form a parallelogram.\nWhat is V? It starts halfway along A and ends halfway along B. The small triangle at the bottom shows V = $A + 3B. This is vector addition-the tail of 3B is at the head of 4A. Together they equal the shortcut V. For the same reason W = 3C + 3D.\nThe heart of the proof is to see these relationships.\nOne step is left. Why is +A + 3B equal to $C + iD? In other words, why is A + B equal to C + D? (I multiplied by 2.) When the right question is asked, the answer jumps out. A head-to-tail addition A + B brings us to the point R. Also C + D brings us to R. The proof comes down to one line:\nA + B = P R = C + D .

The most important functions are linear. Those sentences take us back to the beginning of the book-the graph of mx + b is a line. The goal now is to move into three dimensions, where graphs are surfaces. Eventually the surfaces will be curved. But calculus starts with the flat surfaces that correspond to straight lines:\nWhat are the most important surfaces? Planes.\nWhat are the most important functions? Still linear.\nThe geometrical idea of a plane is turned into algebra, by finding the equation of a plane. Not just a general formula, but the particular equation of a particular plane.\nA line is determined by one point (x,, yo) and the slope m. The point-slope equation is y - yo = m(x - x,). That is a linear equation, it is satisfied when y = yo and x = xo, and dyldx is m. For a plane, we start again with a particular point-which is now\n(x, ,yo, I:,).\nBut the slope of a plane is not so simple. Many planes climb at a 45\" angle-with\n\"slope 1\"-and more information is needed.\nThe direction of a plane is described by a vector N. The vector is not in the plane, but perpmdicular to the plane. In the plane, there are many directions. Perpendicular to the plane, there is only one direction. A vector in that perpendicular direction is a normal vector.\nThe normal vector N can point \"up\" or \"down\". The length of N is not crucial (we often make it a unit vector and call it n). Knowing N and the point Po = (x,, yo, z,), we know the plane (Figure 11.9). For its equation we switch to algebra and use the dot product-which is the key to perpendicularity.\nN is described by its components (a, b, c). In other words N is ai + bj + ck. This vector is perpendicular to every direction in the plane. A typical direction goes from t N = ai + bj + ck normal vector Fig. 11.9 The normal vector to a plane.

That can be rewritten as x + y + z = 6.\nNotice three things. First, Po lies on the plane because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Second, N =\n(1, 1, 1) can be recognized from the x, y, z coefficients in x + y + z = 6. Third, we could change N to (2,2,2) and we could change Po to (8,2, - 4)-because N is still perpendicular and Po is still in the plane: 8 + 2 - 4 = 6.\nThe new normal vector N = (2,2,2) produces 2(x - 1) + 2(y - 2) + 2(z - 3) = 0.\nThat can be rewritten as 2x + 2y + 22 = 12. Same normal direction, same plane.\nThe new point Po = (8, 2, - 4) produces (x - 8) + (y - 2) + (z + 4) = 0. That is another form of x + y + z = 6. All we require is a perpendicular N and a point Po in the plane.\nEXAMPLE 2 The plane through (1,2,4) with the same N = (1, 1, 1) has a different equation: (x - 1) + (y - 2) + (z - 4) = 0.

These planes with 7 and 6 are parallel.\nStarting from a(x - x,) + b(y - yo) + c(z - 2,) = 0, we often move ax, + by, + cz, to the right hand side-and call this constant d:\n1 ID With the Po terms on the right side, the equation of the plane is N P = d:\nax+by+cz=axo+ byo+czo=d.\n(2) A different d gives a puraIle1 plane; d = 0 gives a plane throzcgh the origin.\nEXAMPLE 3 The plane x - y + 3z = 0 goes through the origin (0, 0, 0). The normal vector is read directly from the equation: N = (1, - 1, 3). The equation is satisfied by Po = (1, 1,O) and P = (l,4, 1). Subtraction gives a vector V = (0, 3, 1) that is in the plane, and N V = 0.\nThe parallel planes x - y + 32 = d have the same N but different d's. These planes miss the origin because d is not zero (x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 on the left side needs d = 0 on the right side). Note that 3x - 3y + 9z = - 15 is parallel to both planes. N is changed to 3N in Figure 11.9, but its direction is not changed.\nEXAMPLE 4 The angle between two planes is the angle between their normal vectors.\nThe planes x - y + 3z = 0 and 3y + z = 0 are perpendicular, because (1, - 1, 3)\n(0, 3, 1) = 0. The planes z = 0 and y = 0 are also perpendicular, because (O,0, 1)\n(0, 1,O) = 0. (Those are the xy plane and the xz plane.)

Parallel and perpendicular to a line. A line in space through P0 and Q.\nRemark 1 We gave the \"point-slope\" equation of a line (using m), and the \"pointnormal\" equation of a plane (using N). What is the normal vector N to a line?\nThe vector V = (1, m) is parallel to the line y = mx + b. The line goes across by 1 and up by m. The perpendicular vector is N = (- m, 1). The dot product N V is\n- m + m = 0. Then the point-normal equation matches the point-slope equation:\n- m(x - x0 ) + 1(y - yo) = 0 is the same as y - yo = m(x - xo).\n(3) Remark 2 What is the point-slope equation for a plane? The difficulty is that a plane has different slopes in the x and y directions. The function f(x, y)= m(x - x0) + M(y - yo) has two derivatives m and M.\nThis remark has to stop. In Chapter 13, \"slopes\" become \"partial derivatives.\" A LINE IN SPACE In three dimensions, a line is not as simple as a plane. A line in space needs two equations. Each equation gives a plane, and the line is the intersection of two planes.\nThe equations x + y + z = 3 and 2x + 3y + z = 6 determine a line.\nTwo points on that line are P0 = (1, 1, 1) and Q = (3, 0, 0). They satisfy both equations so they lie on both planes. Therefore they are on the line of intersection. The direction of that line, subtracting coordinates of P0 from Q, is along the vector V = 2i - j - k.\nThe line goes through P0 = (1, 1, 1) in the direction of V = 2i - j - k.\nStarting from (xo, Yo, zo) = (1, 1, 1), add on any multiple tV. Then x = 1 + 2t and y= 1 - t and z = 1 - t. Those are the components of the vector equation P = P0 + tV-which produces the line.\nHere is the problem. The line needs two equations-or a vector equation with a parameter t. Neither form is as simple as ax + by + cz = d. Some books push ahead anyway, to give full details about both forms. After trying this approach, I believe that those details should wait. Equations with parameters are the subject of Chapter 12, and a line in space is the first example. Vectors and planes give plenty to do here-especially when a vector is projected onto another vector or a plane.\nPROJECTION OF A VECTOR What is the projection of a vector B onto another vector A?

The hypotenuse is IBI. The length is IPI = HBI cos 0. The perpendicular component B - P has length IBI sin 0. The cosine is positive for angles less than 900. The cosine (and P!) are zero when A and B are perpendicular. IBI cos 0 is negative for angles greater than 900, and the projection points along -A (the length is IBI Icos 01).

We find t by requiring P = tN to lie on the plane.\nThe plane x + 2y + 2z = 5 has normal vector N = (1, 2, 2). Therefore P = tN =\n(t, 2t, 2t).

There are also six chest leads, to add a front-back dimension that is monitored across the heart. We will concentrate on the big \"Einthoven triangle,\" named after the inventor of the ECG.\nThe graphs show voltage variations plotted against time. The first graph plots the voltage difference between the arms. Lead II connects the left leg to the right arm.\nLead III completes the triangle, which has roughly equal sides (especially if you are a little lopsided). So the projections are based on 600 and 1200 angles.\nThe heart vector V is the sum of many small vectors-all moved to the same origin. V is the net effect of action potentials from the cells-small dipoles adding to a single dipole. The pacemaker (S-A node) starts the impulse. The atria depolarize to give the P wave on the graphs. This is actually a P loop of the heart vector-the LEAD aVR LtAU III Fig. A The graphs show the component of the moving heart vector along each lead.

The impulse reaches the AV node, pauses, and moves quickly through the ventricles. This produces the QRS complex-the large sharp movement on the graph.\nThe total QRS interval should not exceed 1/10 second (2i spaces on the printout).\nV points first toward the right shoulder. This direction is opposite to the leads, so the tracings go slightly down. That is the Q wave, small and negative. Then the heart vector sweeps toward the left leg. In positions 3 and 4, its projection on lead I\n(between the arms) is strongly positive. The R wave is this first upward deflection in each lead. Closing the loop, the S wave is negative (best seen in leads I and aVR).\nQuestion 1 How many graphs from the arms and leg are really independent?\nAnswer Only two! In a plane, the heart vector V has two components. If we know two projections, we can compute the others. (The ECG does that for us.) Different vectors show better in different projections. A mathematician would use 90\" angles, with an electrode at your throat.\nQuestion 2 How are the voltages related?

The direction of T is along the axis of rotation, at right angles to R and F.\nEXAMPLE 3 Does the cross product go up or down? Use the right-hand rule.\nForces and torques are probably just fine for physicists. Those who are not natural physicists want to see something turn.t We can visualize a record or compact disc rotating around its axis-which comes up through the center.\nAt a point on the disc, you give a push. When the push is outward (hard to do), nothing turns. Rotation comes from force \"around\" the axis. The disc can turn either way-depending on the angle between force and position. A sign convention is necessary, and it is the right-hand rule:\nA x B points along your right thumb when the fingers curl from A toward B.\nThis rule is simplest for the vectors i, j, k in Figure 11.14-which is all we need.\nSuppose the fingers curl from i to j. The thumb points along k. The x-y-z axes form a \"right-handed triple.\" Since li| = 1 and I|j = 1 and sin 7n/2 = 1, the length of i x j is 1. The cross product is i x j = k. The disc turns counterclockwise-its angular velocity is up-when the force acts at i in the direction j.\nFigure 11.14b reverses i and j. The force acts at j and its direction is i. The disc turns clockwise (the way records and compact discs actually turn). When the fingers curl from j to i, the thumb points down. Thus j x i = - k. This is a special case of an amazing rule:\nThe cross product is anticommutative: B x A = - (A x B).\n(3) That is quite remarkable. Its discovery by Hamilton produced an intellectual revolution in 19th century algebra, which had been totally accustomed to AB = BA. This commutative law is old and boring for numbers (it is new and boring for dot products). Here we see its opposite for vector products A x B. Neither law holds for matrix products.\nixj=k ixk turning jx k = i axis screw going in screw coming out Fig. 11.14 ixj=k=-(jxi) ixk=-j=-(kxi) jxk=i=-(kxj).\nEXAMPLE 4 A screw goes into a wall or out, following the right-hand rule.\nThe disc was in the xy plane. So was the force. (We are not breaking records here.) The axis was up and down. To see the cross product more completely we need to turn a screw into a wall.\nFigure 11.14b shows the xz plane as the wall. The screw is in the y direction. By turning from x toward z we drive the screw into the wall-which is the negative y direction. In other words i x k equals minus j. We turn the screw clockwise to make it go in. To take out the screw, twist from k toward i. Then k x i equals plus j.\ntEverybody is a natural mathematician.

(Anticyclic is minus.) The z-x-y and y-z-x axes form righthanded triples like x-y-z.\nTHE FORMULA FOR THE CROSS PRODUCT We begin the algebra of A x B. It is essential for computation, and it comes out beautifully. The square roots in IAI IBI Isin 01 will disappear in formula (6) for A x B.\n(The square roots also disappeared in A * B, which is IAI IBI cos 0. But IAl IBI tan 0 would be terrible.) Since A x B is a vector we need to find three components.\nStart with the two-dimensional case. The vectors a, i + a2j and b, i + b2j are in the xy plane. Their cross product must go in the z direction. Therefore A x B =\n? k and there is only one nonzero component. It must be IAI IBI sin 0 (with the correct sign), but we want a better formula. There are two clean ways to compute A x B, either by algebra (a) or by a bridge (b) to the dot product and geometry:\n(a) (ai+a 2j) x (bi+b2j)=albixi+ab 2 ixj + a2bjxi+a2b2jx j.\n(4) On the right are 0, ab 2k, -a 2b1 k, and 0. The cross product is (ab 2 - a2b,)k.\n(b) Rotate B= bli + b2j clockwise through 90o into B* = b2i- b1j.\nIts length is unchanged (and B - B* = 0). Then IAI IBI sin 0 equals IAl IB*I cos 0, which is A \" B*:\nIAIIBI sin = A B*= a1 b2 2bl.\n(5) SF In the xy plane, A x B equals (ab 2 - a2b)k. The parallelogram with sides A and B has area |a1 b2 - a2b 1. The triangle OAB has area -|a, b2 - a2b 1.\nEXAMPLE 5 For A = i + 2j and B = 4i + 5j the cross product is (1 5 - 2 -4)k = - 3k.\nArea of parallelogram = 3, area of triangle = 3/2. The minus sign in A x B = - 3k is absent in the areas.\nNote Splitting A x B into four separate cross products is correct, but it does not follow easily from IAl IBI sin 0. Method (a) is not justified until Remark 1 below. An algebraist would change the definition of A x B to start with the distributive law\n(splitting rule) and the anticommutative law:\nAx(B+C)=(AxB)+(AxC) and AxB=-(BxA).\nTHE CROSS PRODUCT FORMULA (3 COMPONENTS) We move to three dimensions. The goal is to compute all three components of A x B\n(not just the length). Method (a) splits each vector into its i, j, k components, making nine separate cross products:\n(ali + a2j + a3k) x (bai + b2j + b3k) = alb2(i x i) + alb 2(i x j) + seven more terms.\nRemember i x i = j x j = k x k = 0. Those three terms disappear. The other six terms come in pairs, and please notice the cyclic pattern:\nFORMULA A x B = (a2b3 - a 3b2)i + (a3b, - a1b3)j + (alb2 - a2b,)k.\n(6) The k component is the 2 x 2 answer, when a3 = b3 = 0.

Never add the - 3, 6, and - 3.\nRemark 1 The three-dimensional formula (6) is still to be matched with A x B from geometry. One way is to rotate B into B* as before, staying in the plane of A and B.\nFortunately there is an easier test. The vector in equation (6) satisfies all four geometric requirements on A x B: perpendicular to A, perpendicular to B, correct length, right-hand rule. The length is checked in Problem 16-here is the zero dot product with A:\nA (A x B)= al(a 2b3 - a3b2)+ a2(a 3b - ab 3)+ a3(ab 2 - a2b)= 0.\n(7) Remark 2 (Optional) There is a wonderful extension of the Pythagoras formula a2 + b2 = c2. Instead of sides of a triangle, we go to areas of projections on the yz, xz, and xy planes. 32 + 62 + 32 is the square of the parallelogram area in Example 6.\nFor triangles these areas are cut in half. Figure 11.15a shows three projected triangles of area 1. Its Pythagoras formula is (1)2 + (1)2 + (½)2 = (area of PQR) 2.\nEXAMPLE 7 P = (1, 0, 0), Q = (0, 1, 0), R = (0, 0, 1) lie in a plane. Find its equation.\nIdea for any P, Q, R: Find vectors A and B in the plane. Compute the normal N = A x B.\nSolution The vector from P to Q has components -1, 1, 0. It is A = j - i (subtract to go from P to Q). Similarly the vector from P to R is B = k - i. Since A and B are in the plane of Figure 11.15, N = A x B is perpendicular:\n(j - i) x (k - i)=(j x k)- (i x k)-(j x i)+(i x i)= i + j + k.\n(8) The normal vector is N = i + j + k.

The third is a unit square (A = i, B = j).\nNow move to three dimensions, where determinants are most useful. The parallelogram becomes a parallelepiped. The word \"box\" is much shorter, and we will use it, but remember that the box is squashed. (Like a rectangle squashed to a parallelogram, the angles are generally not 900.) The three edges from the origin are A = (a,, a2, a3), B=(bl, b2, b3), C=(c1 , C2, c 3). Those edges are at right angles only when A B= A C = B*C= 0.\nQuestion: What is the volume of the box? The right-angle case is easy-it is length times width times height. The volume is IAI times IBI times ICI, when the angles are 90'. For a squashed box (Figure 11.15) we need the perpendicular height, not the sloping height.\nThere is a beautiful formula for volume. B and C give a parallelogram in the base, and lB x CI is the base area. This cross product points straight up. The third vector A points up at an angle-its perpendicular height is JAl cos 0. Thus the volume is area IB x CI times JAI times cos 0. The volume is the dot product of A with B x C.\n11G The triple scalar product is A (B x C). Volume of box = IA (B x C)I.\nImportant: A . (B x C) is a number, not a vector. This volume is zero when A is in the same plane as B and C (the box is totally flattened). Then B x C is perpendicular to A and their dot product is zero.\nUsefulfacts: A (Bx C)=(Ax B)C=C (Ax B)=B.(C xA).\nAll those come from the same box, with different sides chosen as base-but no change in volume. Figure 11.15 has B and C in the base but it can be A and B or A and C.\nThe triple product A- (C x B) has opposite sign, since C x B = - (B x C). This order ACB is not cyclic like ABC and CAB and BCA.\nTo compute this triple product A . (B x C), we take B x C from equation (6):\nA (B x C) = al(b2c3 - b3C2) + a2(b3c1 - blC3) + a3(blc 2 - b2Cl).\n(9) The numbers a,, a2, a3 multiply 2 by 2 determinants to give a 3 by 3 determinant!\nThere are three terms with plus signs (like alb2c3).

Eventually we get back to calculus, where functions are nonlinear-but linear equations come first. In Chapter 1, y = mx + b produced a line. Two equations produce two lines. If they cross, the intersection point solves both equations-and we want to find it.\nThree equations in three variables x, y, z produce three planes. Again they go through one point (usually). Again the problem is to find that intersection point\n-which solves the three equations.\nThe ultimate problem is to solve n equations in n unknowns. There are n hyperplanes in n-dimensional space, which meet at the solution. We need a test to be sure they meet. We also want the solution. These are the objectives of linear algebra, which joins with calculus at the center of pure and applied mathematics.?\nLike every subject, linear algebra requires a good notation. To state the equations and solve them, we introduce a \"matrix.\" The problem will be Au = d. The solution will be u = A-'d. It remains to understand where the equations come from, where the answer comes from, and what the matrices A and A - ' stand for.\nTWO EQUATIONS IN TWO UNKNOWNS Linear algebra has no reason to choose one variable as special. The equation y - yo = m(x - xo) separates y from x. A better equation for a line is ax + by = d. (A vertical\n?Linear algebra dominates some applications while calculus governs others.

There are parts of life where you never know what is going on (until too late). But two equations in two unknowns can have no mysteries. There are three ways to write the system-by rows, by columns, and by matrices. Please look at all three, since setting up a problem is generally harder and more important than solving it. After that comes the concession to the real world:\nwe compute x and y.\nEXAMPLE 1 How do you invest $5000 to earn $400 a year interest, if a money market account pays 5% and a deposit account pays lo%?\nSet up equations by rows: With x dollars at 5% the interest is .05x. With y dollars at 10% the interest is .10y. One row for principal, another row for interest:\nSame equations by columns: The left side of (2) contains x times one vector plus y times another vector. The right side is a third vector. The equation by columns is Same equations by matrices: Look again at the left side. There are two unknowns x and y, which go into a vector u. They are multiplied by the four numbers 1, .05, 1, and .lo, which go into a two by two matrix A. The left side becomes a matrix times a vector:\nNOW you see where the \"rows\" and \"columns\" came from. They are the rows and columns of a matrix. The rows entered the separate equations (2). The columns entered the vector equation (3).

It has a column for each unknown (usually n columns). For 2 equations in 3 unknowns it is a 2 by 3 matrix (therefore rectangular). For 6 equations in 6 unknowns the matrix is 6 by 6\n(therefore square).

The real problem is to find x and y when they are unknown. We solve two equations with letters not numbers:\na x + b y = d, a2x + b2y= d2.\nThe key is to eliminate x. Multiply the first equation by a2 and the second equation by a,. Subtract the first from the second and the x's disappear:\n(ab 2 - a2bl)y = (ad 2 - a2d,).\nTo eliminate y, subtract b, times the second equation from b2 times the first:\n(b2al - b a2 )x = (b2d, - bid 2).\nWhat you see in those parentheses are 2 by 2 determinants!

They are small enough so that all solution methods apply. Cramer's Rule uses determinants. Larger systems use elimination\n(3 by 3 matrices are on the borderline). A third solution (the same solution!) comes from the inverse matrix A-', to be described next. But the inverse is more a symbol for the answer than a new way of computing it, because to find A-' we still use determinants or elimination.\nTHE INVERSE OF A MATRIX The symbol A-' is pronounced \"A inverse.\" It stands for a matrix-the one that solves Au = d. I think of A as a matrix that takes u to d. Then A-' is a matrix that takes d back to u. If Au = d then u = A- 'd (provided the inverse exists). This is exactly like functions and inverse functions: g(x) = y and x =gP'(y). Our goal is to find A - ' when we know A.\nThe first approach will be very direct.

It starts with three-dimensional vectors a, b, d and leads to a 2 by 2 system. One good feature: a, b, d can be n-dimensional with no change in the algebra. In practice that happens. Second good feature: There is a calculus problem in the background. The example is tofit points by a straight line.\nThere are three ways to state the problem, and they look different:\n1.

The projection minimizes the error (by geometry), the normal equations (14) minimize the error (by algebra), and now calculus minimizes the error by setting the derivatives of E to zero.\nThe new feature is this: E depends on two variables x and y. Therefore E has two derivatives. They both have to be zero at the minimum. That gives two equations for x and y:\nx derivative of E is zero: 2(x + y) + 2(x + 2y - 5)\n+ 2(x + 3y - 4)\n= 0 y derivative of E is zero: 2(x + y) + 2(x + 2y - 5)(2) + 2(x + 3y - 4)(3) = 0.\nWhen we divide by 2, those are the normal equations 3x + 6y = 9 and 6x + 14y = 22.

These vectors b and d, together with a = (1, 1, ... , 1), determine a projection-the combination p = xa + yb that is closest to d.

There are three unknowns x, y, z and also three equations. This is at the crossover point between formulas and algorithms-it is real linear algebra. The formulas give a direct solution using determinants. The algorithms use elimination and the numbers x, y, z appear at the end. In practice that end result comes quickly. Computers solve linear equations by elimination.\nThe situation for a nonlinear equation is similar. Quadratic equations ax2 + bx + c = 0 are solved by a formula. Cubic equations are solved by Newton's method (even though a formula exists). For equations involving x or x lo, algorithms take over completely.\nSince we are at the crossover point, we look both ways. This section has a lot to do, in mixing geometry, determinants, and 3 by 3 matrices:\n1. The row picture: three planes intersect at the solution 2. The column picture: a vector equation combines the columns 3. The formulas: determinants and Cramer's Rule 4. Matrix multiplication and A -' 5. The algorithm: Gaussian elimination.\nPart of our goal is three-dimensional calculus. Another part is n-dimensional algebra.\nAnd a third possibility is that you may not take mathematics next year.

Linear equations are so basic and important, in such a variety of applications, that the effort in this section is worth making.\nAn example is needed. It is convenient and realistic if the matrix contains zeros.\nMost equations in practice are fairly simple-a thousand equations each with 990 zeros would be very reasonable. Here are three equations in three unknowns:\nx+ y\n= 1 x\n+ 2z = 0\n(1)\n- 2y + 2z = -4.\nIn matrix-vector form, the unknown u has components x, y, z. The right sides 1, 0, - 4 go into d.

In the xy plane that produces a line. In three dimensions it is a plane. It has the usual form ax + by + cz = d, except that c happens to be zero. The plane is easy to visualize (Figure 11.20a), because it cuts straight down through the line. The equation x + y = 1 allows z to have any value, so the graph includes all points above and below the line.\nThe second equation x + 2z = 0 gives a second plane, which goes through the origin. When the right side is zero, the point (0, 0, 0) satisfies the equation. This time y is absent from the equation, so the plane contains the whole y axis. All points (0, y, 0) meet the requirement x + 2z = 0. The normal vector to the plane is N = i + 2k. The plane cuts across, rather than down, in 11.20b.\nBefore the third equation we combine the first two. The intersection of two planes is a line. In three-dimensional space, two equations (not one) describe a line. The points on the line have to satisfy x + y = 1 and also x + 2z = 0. A convenient point is P = (0, 1, 0). Another point is Q = (-1, 2, -). The line through P and Q extends out in both directions.\nThe solution is on that line.

What is important is the point where the three planes meet. The intersection line of the first two planes crosses the third plane.\nWe used determinants (but elimination is better) to find x = - 2, y = 3, z = 1. This solution satisfies the three equations and lies on the three planes.\nA brief comment on 4 by 4 systems. The first equation might be x + y + z - t = 0.\nIt represents a three-dimensional \"hyperplane\" in four-dimensional space. (In physics this is space-time.) The second equation gives a second hyperplane, and its intersection with the first one is two-dimensional. The third equation (third hyperplane) reduces the intersection to a line. The fourth hyperplane meets that line at a point, which is the solution. It satisfies the four equations and lies on the four hyperplanes. In this course three dimensions are enough.\nCOLUMN PICTURE: COMBINATION OF COLUMN VECTORS There is an extremely important way to rewrite our three equations. In (1) they were separate, in (2) they went into a matrix. Now they become a vector equation:\nThe columns of the matrix are multiplied by x, y, z. That is a special way to see matrixvector multiplication: Au is a combination of the columns of A. We are looking for the numbers x, y, z so that the combination produces the right side d.\nThe column vectors a, b, c are shown in Figure 11.21a. The vector equation is xa + yb + zc = d. The combination that solves this equation must again be x = - 2, y = 3, z = 1. That agrees with the intersection point of the three planes in the row picture.\n1 { a, b, c in ney c,', same plane d not in that plane:\nno solution O = lc+2b-2a Fig. 11.21 Columns combine to give d.

Now the row picture has three planes, which need not be parallel. Here the planes are not parallel. Their normal vectors are the rows of S, which go in different directions. But somehow the planes fail to go through a common point.\nWhat happens is more subtle. The intersection line from two planes misses the third plane. The line is parallel to the plane and stays above it (Figure 11.22a). When all three planes are drawn, they form an open tunnel. The picture tells more than the numbers, about how three planes can fail to meet. The third figure shows an end view, where the planes go directly into the page. Each pair meets in a line, but those lines don't meet in a point.\nFig. 11.22 The row picture in the singular case: no intersection point, no solution.\nWhen two planes are parallel, the determinant is again zero.

The vector R(t) = ti + t2j+ t3k is moving. It is a function of the parameter t, which often represents time. At each time t, the position vector R(t) locates the moving body:\nposition vector =R(t) =x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k.\n(1) Our example has x = t, y = t2, z =t3. As t varies, these points trace out a curve in space. The parameter t tells when the body passes each point on the curve. The constant vector 2i +4j + 8k is the position vector R(2) at the instant t =2.\nWhat are the questions to be asked? Every student of calculus knows the first question: Find the deriuatiue. If something moves, the Navy salutes it and we differentiate it. At each instant, the body moving along the curve has a speed and a direction.\nThis information is contained in another vector function-the velocity vector v(t) which is the derivative of R(t):\nSince i, j, k are fixed vectors, their derivatives are zero. In polar coordinates i and j are replaced by moving vectors. Then the velocity v has more terms from the product rule (Section 12.4).\nTwo important cases are uniform motion along a line and around a circle. We study those motions in detail (v =constant on line, v =tangent to circle). This section also finds the speed and distance and acceleration for any motion R(t).\nEquation (2) is the computing rulefor the velocity dR/dt. It is not the definition of dR/dt, which goes back to basics and does not depend on coordinates:\ndR AR lim R(t + At) -R(t)\n- lim -= dt at+o At At+O At We repeat: R is a vector so AR is a vector so dR/dt is a vector.

When t = 0 the velocity is v = i. The tangent is along the x axis, since the j and k components are zero.

The position vector moves with dR/dt = v:\nR(t) = R, + tv (R, fixed, v fixed, t varying)\n(3) That is the equation of a line in vector form. Certainly dR/dt = v. The starting point R, = x,i + yd + zok is given. The velocity v = v1 i + v2j + v3k is also given. Separating the x, y and z components, equation (3) for a line is line with parameter: x = xo + tul , y = yo + tv,, z = z, + tv, .\n(4) The direction of the line is the unit vector v/lvl. We have three equations for x, y, z, and eliminating t leaves two equations.\nThe parameter t equals (x -xo)/vl from equation (4). It also equals (y -y0)/v2and\n(z -zO)iv3.SOthese ratios equal each other, and t is gone:\nline without parameter: x-xo y-yo 2-2,\n-\n-\n- - -.\n01 v2 v3\n(5) An example is x = y/2 = z/3. In this case (x,, yo, z,) = (0, 0, 0)-the line goes through the origin. Another point on the line is (x, y, z) = (2,4 6). Because t is gone, we cannot say when we reach that point and how fast we are going. The equations x/4 = y/8 = 2/12 give the same line. Without t we can't know the velocity v = dR/dt.\nEXAMPLE 3 Find an equation for the line through P = (0,2, 1) and Q = (1,3,3).\nSolution We have choices! R, can go to any point on the line. The velocity v can be any multiple of the vector from P to Q. The decision on R, controls where we start, and v controls our speed.\nThe vector from P to Q is i + j + 2k.

The vector R* is at a different point on the same line at the same time: x* = 1 + 2t, y* = 3 + 2t, z* = 3 + 4t.\nIf I pick t = 1 in R and t = 0 in R*, the point is (1,3,3). We arrive there at different times. You are seeing how parameters work, to tell \"where\" and also \"when.\" If t goes from - GO to + GO, all points on one line are also on the other line.

This derivative is zero at t = - I. So the closest point is (- 1, 1, - 1).\nQuestion 5 Where does the line meet the plane x + y + z = 1 I?\nAnswer Equation (6) gives x + y + z = 3 + 4t = 11.

We give the starting point and velocity:\n(x, y, z) = (x,, yo, z, ) + t(v, , v2, v,). That tells directly which points are on the line.\nOr we eliminate t to find the two equations in (5).\nA plane has one equation or two parameters! The equation is ax + by + cz = d.\nThat tells us indirectly which points are on the plane. (Instead of knowing x, y, z, we know the equation they satisfy. Instead of directions v and w in the plane, we are told the perpendicular direction N =(a, b, c).) With parameters, the line contains R, + tv and the plane contains R, + tv + sw. A plane looks worse with parameters\n(t and s), a line looks better.\nQuestions 5 and 6 connected lines to planes. Here are two more.

Distance along a curve is always denoted by s (called arc length). I don't know why we use s-certainly not as the initial for speed. In fact speed is distance divided by time. The ratio s/t gives average speed;\ndsldt is instantaneous speed.

The ball leaves the pitcher's hand five feet off the ground: Ro = Oi + Oj + 5k. The initial velocity is vo = 120i - 2j + 2k (120 ft/sec is more than 80 miles per hour). The acceleration is - 32k from gravity, plus a new term from spin. If the spin is around the z axis, and the ball goes along the x axis, then this acceleration is in the y direction. (It comes from the cross product k x i-there is a pressure difference on the sides of the ball.) A good pitcher can achieve a = 16j - 32k.\nThe batter integrates as fast as he can:\nv(t) = vo + at = 120i + (-2 + 16t)j + (2 - 32t)k R(t) = Ro + vot + ½at2 = 120t i + (-2t + 8t2)j + (5 + 2t - 16t 2)k.\nNotice the t2. The effect of spin is small at first, then suddenly bigger (as every batter knows). So is the effect of gravity-the ball starts to dive. At t = -, the i component is 60 feet and the ball reaches the batter. The j component is 1 foot and the k component is 2 feet-the curve goes low over the outside corner.\nAt t = 1, when the batter saw the ball halfway, the j component was zero.

The laws of physics govern projectiles, and the motion of a wheel produces a cycloid (which enters problems in robotics). The projectiles fly without friction, so the only force is gravity.\nThese motions occur in a plane. The two components of position will be x (across) and y (up). A projectile moves as t changes, so we look for x(t) and y(t).

Some flights start higher, at (0, h). The initial velocity is (v, cos a, v, sin a), where v, is the speed and a is the angle with the horizontal. The acceleration from gravity is purely vertical: d 2y/dt2 = -g. SO the horizontal velocity stays at its initial value. The upward velocity decreases by -gt:\ndxldt = v, cos a, dyldt = vo sin a -gt.\nThe horizontal distance x(t) is steadily increasing. The height y(t) increases and then decreases. To find the position, integrate the velocities (for a high start add h to y):\nThe projectile path is x(t) = (v, cos a)t ,y(t) = (vo sin a)t -igt2.\n(1) This path is a parabola. But it is not written as y = ax2+ bx + c. It could be, if we eliminated t. Then we would lose track of time. The parabola is y(x), with no parameter, where we have x(t) and y(t).\nBasic question: Where does the projectile hit the ground? For the parabola, we solve y(x) = 0. That gives the position x. For the projectile we solve y(t) = 0. That gives the time it hits the ground, not the place. If that time is T,then x(T) gives the place.\nThe information is there. It takes two steps instead of one, but we learn more.\nEXAMPLE 1 Water leaves the hose at 10 meters/second (this is v,). It starts up at the angle a. Find the time T when y is zero again, and find where the projectile lands.\nSolution The flight ends when y = (10 sin a)T -igT2 = 0. The flight time is T =\n(20 sin a)/g. At that time, the horizontal distance is x(T) = (10 cos a)T = (200 cos a sin a)/g. This is the range R.\nThe projectile (or water from the hose) hits the ground at x = R. To simplify, replace 200 cos a sin a by 100 sin 2a. Since g = 9.8 meters/sec2, we can't reach the car:\nThe range R = (100 sin 2~)/9.8 is at most 10019.8. This is less than 12.\nThe range is greatest when sin 2a = I (a is 45\"). To reach 12 meters we could stand on a ladder (Problem 14).

The starting angles a = 30\" and a = 60\" in Figure 12.5 give the same sin 2a and the same range R. The flight times contain sin a and are different.\nBy calculus, the maximum height occurs when dyldt = 0. Then vo sin a =gt, which means that t = (v, sin ix)/g.

The basic equation (2) is x = (28 cos a)t, y = (28 sin a)t -fgt 2.\nThose are two equations for a and t. Note that t is not T, the flight time to y =0.\nConclusion The position of a projectile involves three parameters vo, a, and t. Three pieces of information determine theflight (almost). The reason for the word almost is the presence of sin a and cos a. Some flight requirements cannot be met (reaching a car at 12 meters). Other requirements can be met in two ways (when the car is close).\nThe equation sin ct = c is more likely to have no solution or two solutions than exactly one solution.\nWatch for the three pieces of information in each problem.

This is like a lawyer who is asked the fee and says $1000 for three questions.\n\"Isn't that steep?\" says the client. \"Yes,\" says the lawyer, \"now what's your last question?\" A projectile's path is a parabola. To compute it, eliminate t from the equations for x and y. Problem 5 finds y = ax2 + bx, a parabola through the origin. The path of a point on a wheel seems equally simple, but eliminating t is virtually impossible. The cycloid is a curve that really needs and uses a parameter.\nTo trace out a cycloid, roll a circle of radius a along the x axis. Watch the point that starts at the bottom of the circle. It comes back to the bottom at x = 2na, after a complete turn of the circle. The path in between is shown in Figure 12.6. After a century of looking for the xy equation, a series of great scientists (Galileo, Christopher Wren, Huygens, Bernoulli, even Newton and l'H6pital) found the right way to study a cycloid-by introducing a parameter. We will call it 8; it could also be t.\nFig. 12.6 Path of P on a rolling circle is a cycloid.

That is the shortest sliding time for any curve. The cycloid solves the \"brachistochrone problem,\" which minimizes the time down curves from 0 to Q (Figure 12.6). You might think a straight path would be quicker-it is certainly shorter. A straight line has the equation x =71~12, so the sliding time is J d t = ~ d s / & = J r J m d y / & = & Z Z J & .\n(5) This is larger than the cycloid time a&.\nIt is better to start out vertically and pick up speed early, even if the path is longer.\nInstead of publishing his solution, John Bernoulli turned this problem into an international challenge: Prove that the cycloid gives the fastest slide. Most mathematicians couldn't do it. The problem reached Isaac Newton (this was later in his life).\nAs you would expect, Newton solved it. For some reason he sent back his proof with no name. But when Bernoulli received the answer, he was not fooled for a moment:\n\"I recognize the lion by his claws.\" What is also amazing is a further property of the cycloid: The time to Q is the same ifyou begin anywhere along the path. Starting from rest at P instead of 0 , the bottom is reached at the same time. This time Bernoulli got carried away: \"You will be petrified with astonishment when I say...\".\nThere are other beautiful curves, closely related to the cycloid. For an epicycloid, the circle rolls around the outside of another circle. For a hypocycloid, the rolling circle is inside the fixed circle.

The first two change the speed. Turning the wheel changes the direction. All three change the velocity (they give acceleration). For steady motion around a circle, the change is from steering-the acceleration dvldt points to the center. We now look at motion along other curves, to separate change in the speed Ivl from change in the direction T.\nThe direction of motion is T = vllvl. It depends on the path but not the speed\n(because we divide by Ivl). For turning we measure two things:\n1. How fast T turns: this will be the curvature K (kappa).\n2. Which direction T turns: this will be the normal vector N.\nK and N depend, like s and T, only on the shape of the curve. Replacing t by 2t or t2 leaves them unchanged. For a circle we give the answers in advance. The normal vector N points to the center. The curvature K is llradius.\nA smaller turning circle means a larger curvature K: more bending..\nThe curvature K is change in direction (dTI divided by change in position Idsl. There are three formulas for rc-a direct one for graphs y(x), a brutal but valuable one for any parametric curve (x(t), y(t)), and a neat formula that uses the vectors v and a.

It also has a specific purpose- to study central forces and the motion of planets. The main gravitational force on a planet is from the sun. It is a central force, because it comes from the sun at the center. Polar coordinates are natural, so the two purposes go together.\nYou may feel that the planets are too old for this course. But Kepler's laws are more than theorems, they are something special in the history of mankind-\"the greatest scientific discovery of all time.\" If we can recapture that glory we should do it. Part of the greatness is in the difficulty-Kepler was working sixty years before Newton discovered calculus. From pages of observations, and some terrific guesses, a theory was born. We will try to preserve the greatness without the difficulty, and show how elliptic orbits come from calculus. The first conclusion is quick.\nMotion in a central force #eld always stays in a plane.\nF is a multiple of the vector R from the origin (central force). F also equals ma\n(Newton's Law). Therefore R and a are in the same direction and R x a = 0. Then R x v has zero derivative and is constant:\nd by the product rule: -(R x v ) = v x v + R x a=O+O.\ndt\n(1) R x v is a constant vector H. So R stays in the plane perpendicular to H.\nHow does a planet move in that plane? We turn to polar coordinates. At each point except the origin (where the sun is), u, is the unit vector ointing outward.

One of Kepler's inspirations, after many struggles, was to get away from circles.\nKEPLER'S LAWS You may know that before Newton and Leibniz and calculus and polar coordinates, Johannes Kepler discovered three laws of planetary motion. He was the court mathematician to the Holy Roman Emperor, who mostly wanted predictions of wars.\nKepler also determined the date of every Easter-no small problem. His triumph was to discover patterns in the observations made by astronomers (especially by Tycho Brahe). Galileo and Copernicus expected circles, but Kepler found ellipses.\nLaw 1: Each planet travels in an ellipse with one focus at the sun.\nLaw 2: The vector from sun to planet sweeps out area at a steady rate: dA/dt = constant.\nLaw 3: The length of the planet's year is T = ka3I2, where a = maximum distance from the center (not the sun) and k = 2n/@ is the same for all planets.\nWith calculus the proof of these laws is a thousand times quicker. But Law 2 is the only easy one. The sun exerts a central force. Equation (I) gave R x v = H = constant for central forces. Replace R by ru, and replace v by equation (5):\nThis vector H is constant, so its length h = r2dO/dt is constant. In polar coordinates, the area is dA =$r2d0. This area dA is swept out by the planet (Figure 12.10), and we have proved Law 2:\ndA/dt =i r 2 d01dt =i h = constant.\n(8) Near the sun r is small. So d0ldt is big and planets go around faster.\nFig. 12.10 The planet is on an ellipse with the sun at a focus. Note a, b, c, q.\nNow for Law 1, about ellipses. We are aiming for 1 /r = C - D cos 0, which is the polar coordinate equation of an ellipse. It is easier to write q than llr, and find an equation for q. The equation we will reach is d 'q/d02 + q = C.

Then q is never zero and r is never infinite. Hyperbolas and parabolas are ruled out, and the orbit in Figure 12.10 must be an ellipse.?\nAstronomy is really impressive. You should visit the Greenwich Observatory in London, to see how Halley watched his comet. He amazed the world by predicting the day it would return. Also the discovery of Neptune was pure mathematicsthe path of Uranus was not accounted for by the sun and known planets. LeVerrier computed a point in the sky and asked a Berlin astronomer to look. Sure enough Neptune was there.\nRecently one more problem was solved-to explain the gap in the asteroids around Jupiter. The reason is \"chaos\"-the three-body problem goes unstable and an asteroid won't stay in that orbit. We have come a long way from circles.\nDepartment of Royal Mistakes The last pound note issued by the Royal Mint showed Newton looking up from his great book Principia Mathematica. He is not smiling and we can see why. The artist put the sun at the center! Newton has just proved it is at the focus. True, the focus is marked S and the planet is P.

Other chapters and other topics may be optional; this chapter and these topics are required. We are back to the basic idea of calculus-the derivative. There is a functionf, the variables move a little bit, and f moves. The question is how much f moves and how fast. Chapters\n.\n1-4 answered this question for f(x), a function of one variable. Now we have f(x, y) orf(x, y, z)-with two or three or more variables that move independently. As x and y change,f changes. The fundamental problem of differential calculus is to connect Ax and Ay to Af.\nCalculus solves that problem in the limit. It connects dx and dy to df.

There are two variables-x is independent and free, y is dependent on x. Above x on the base line is the point (x, y) on the curve. The curve can be displayed on a two-dimensional printed page.\nThe graph of z =f(x, y) is a surface in xyz space. There are three variables-x and y are independent, z is dependent. Above (x, y) in the base plane is the point (x, y, z) on the surface (Figure 13.1). Since the printed page remains two-dimensional, we shade or color or project the surface. The eyes are extremely good at converting twodimensional images into three-dimensional understanding--they get a lot of practice.\nThe mathematical part of our brain also has something new to work on-two partial derivatives.\nThis section uses examples and figures to illustrate surfaces and their level curves.\nThe next section is also short. Then the work begins.\nEXAMPLE I Describe the surface and the level curves for z =f(x, y) = x2 + y2.\nThe surface is a cone. Reason:\nx2 + y2 is the distance in the base plane from (0, 0) to (x, y). When we go out a distance 5 in the base plane, we go up the same distance 5 to the surface. The cone climbs with slope 1. The distance out to (x, y) equals the distance up to z (this is a 450 cone).\nThe level curves are circles. At height 5, the cone contains a circle of points-all at the same \"level\" on the surface. The plane z = 5 meets the surface z = x2 + y2 at those points (Figure 13.1b). The circle below them (in the base plane) is the level curve.\nDEFINITION A level curve or contour line of z =f(x, y) contains all points (x, y) that share the same valuef(x, y) = c. Above those points, the surface is at the height z = c.\nThere are different level curves for different c. To see the curve for c = 2, cut through the surface with the horizontal plane z = 2. The plane meets the surface above the points where f(x, y) = 2. The level curve in the base plane has the equation f(x, y) = 2. Above it are all the points at \"level 2\" or \"level c\" on the surface.\nEvery curve f(x, y) = c is labeled by its constant c. This produces a contour map\n(the base plane is full of curves). For the cone, the level curves are given by\n.x 2 + y2 = c, and the contour map consists of circles of radius c.\nQuestion What are the level curves of z =f(x, y) = x2 + y2?\nAnswer Still circles. But the surface is not a cone (it bends up like a parabola). The circle of radius 3 is the level curve x2 + y2 = 9. On the surface above, the height is 9.\nz= 'x 2+y2 p Y 5base plane\n.- Fig. 13.1 The surface for z =f(x, y) = x2 + y 2 is a cone.

Its level curves are straight lines. The surface z = 2x + y meets the plane z = c in the line 2x + y = c. That line is above the base plane when c is positive, and below when c is negative. The contour lines are in the base plane. Figure 13.2b labels these parallel lines according to their height in the surface.\nQuestion If the level curves are all straight lines, must they be parallel?\nAnswer No. The surface z = y/x has level curves y/x = c.

As c increases the loops become tighter. Similarly the curves squeeze to the lowest point as c decreases.\nEXAMPLE 4 A contour map of a mountain may be the best example of all. Normally the level curves are separated by 100 feet in height. On a steep trail those curves are bunched together-the trail climbs quickly. In a flat region the contour lines are far apart. Water runs perpendicular to the level curves.

If f(x, y) = sin xy then af/ax = y cos xy.\nSpoken aloud, af/ax is still \"d f d x.\" It is a function of x and y. When more is needed, call it \"the partial off with respect to x.\" The symbol f' is no longer available, since it gives no special indication about x. Its replacement fx is pronounced \"fx\" or\n\"fsub x,\" which is shorter than af/ax and means the same thing.\nWe may also want to indicate the point (x,, yo) where the derivative is computed:\nEXAMPLE 2 f(x, y) = sin 2x cos y fx = 2 cos 2x cos y\n(cos y is constant for a/dx) The particular point (x,, yo) is (0,O). The height of the surface is f(0,O) = 0.\nThe slope in the x direction is fx = 2. At a different point x, = n, yo = n we find fx(n, n) = - 2.\nNow keep x constant and vary y. The ratio Af/Ay approaches aflay:\nf,(x, y) = lim f= lim f(x, Y + BY) -f(x, Y) AY+O Ay A ~ + O AY This is the slope in the y direction.

But this change is of order (Ax)2 and the x derivative is zero.\nFigure 13.5 is rather important. It shows how af@x and af/dy are the ordinary derivatives of f(x, yo) and f(x,, y). It is natural to call these partial functions. The first has y fixed at yo while x varies. The second has x fixed at xo while y varies.

With partial functions we are back to a single variable. The partial derivative is the ordinary derivative of a partial function (constant y or constant x). For the cone, af/ay exists at all points except (0, 0). The figure shows how the cross section down the middle of the cone produces the absolute value function:f(0, y) = lyl. It has one-sided derivatives but not a two-sided derivative.\nSimilarly Of/ax will not exist at the sharp point of the cone. We develop the idea of a continuous function f(x, y) as needed (the definition is in the exercises). Each partial derivative involves one direction, but limits and continuity involve all directions. The distance function is continuous at (0, 0), where it is not differentiable.\nEXAMPLE 4 f(x, y) = y 2 af/Ox = - 2x Of/ay = 2y Move in the x direction from (1, 3).

The function 2xy does just as well. The level curves 2xy = c are still hyperbolas. The partial functions 2xyo and 2xoy now give straight lines-which is remarkable. Along the 45\" line x = y, the function is 2x2 and climbing. Along the -45\" line x = - y, the function is -2x2 and falling. The graph of 2xy is Figure 13.6 rotated by 45\".\nEXAMPLES 5-6 f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 P(T, V) = nRT/V Example 5 shows more variables. Example 6 shows that the variables may not be named x and y. Also, the function may not be named f! Pressure and temperature and volume are P and T and V. The letters change but nothing else:\naP/aT = nR/V dP/aV = - ~ R T / V ~ (note the derivative of 1/V).\nThere is no dP/aR because R is a constant from chemistry-not a variable.\nPhysics produces six variables for a moving body-the coordinates x, y, z and the momenta p,, p,, p,. Economics and the social sciences do better than that. If there are 26 products there are 26 variables-sometimes 52, to show prices as well as amounts. The profit can be a complicated function of these variables. The partial derivatives are the marginalprofits, as one of the 52 variables is changed. A spreadsheet shows the 52 values and the effect of a change. An infinitesimal spreadsheet shows the derivative.\nSECOND DERIVATIVE Genius is not essential, to move to second derivatives. The only difficulty is that two first derivatives f, and f, lead to four second derivatives fxx and fxy and f,and f,.\n(Two subscripts: f,, is the x derivative of the x derivative. Other notations are d2 flax2 and a2f/axdy and a*flayax and d2flay2.) Fortunately fxy equals f,, as we see first by example.\nEXAMPLE 7 f = x/y has f, = l/y, which has fxx = 0 and f, = - l/y2.\nThe function x/y is linear in x (which explains fxx = 0). Its y derivative isf, = - xly2.\nThis has the x derivative f,,, = -l/y2. The mixed derivatives fxy and fyx are equal.\nIn the pure y direction, the second derivative isf, = 2x/y3. One-variable calculus is sufficient for all these derivatives, because only one variable is moving.\nEXAMPLE 8 f = 4x2 + 3xy + y2 has f, = 8x + 3y and f,= 3x + 2y.\nBoth \"cross derivatives\" f,, andf,, equal 3. The second derivative in the x direction is a2f/ax2 = 8 or fxx = 8. Thus \"fx x\" is \"d second f d x squared.\" Similarly a2flay2 = 2. The only change is from d to a.\nIff(x, y) has continuous second derivatives then f,, =&,. Problem 43 sketches a proof based on the Mean Value Theorem.

The subscript o indicates the value of x or y or z or 8f/Ox or aflay at the point.\nWith one variable the tangent line has slope df/dx. With two variables there are two derivatives df/8x and Of/Oy. At the particular point, they are (af/ax)o and\n(af/ay)o. Those are the slopes of the tangent plane. Its equation is the key to this chapter:\nEXAMPLE 1 Find the tangent plane to z = 14 - x 2 - y2 at (xo, Yo, zo) = (1, 2, 9).\nSolution The derivatives are af/ax = - 2x and Ofl/y = - 2y. When x = 1 and y = 2 those are (af/ax)o = - 2 and (df/ay)o = - 4. The equation of the tangent plane is z - 9 = - 2(x - 1)- 4(y - 2) or z+2x+4y= 19.\nThis z(x, y) has derivatives - 2 and - 4, just like the surface. So the plane is tangent.\nThe normal vector N has components -2,\n-4, -1. The equation of the normal line is (x, y, z) = (1, 2, 9) + t(- 2, - 4, - 1).

The dotted lines are the x and y tangent lines. They lie in the plane. All tangent lines lie in the tangent plane!\nThese particular lines are tangent to the \"partial functions\"--where y is fixed at Yo = 2 or x is fixed at x0 = 1.

The coordinates are (xo, Yo, zo) = (1, 2, 3). The normal vector is ii + 2j + 3k. The tangent equation is lx + 2y + 3z = 14. None of this can be an accident, but the square root of 14 - x 2 - y2 made a simple pattern look complicated.\nThis square root is not necessary.

Then equation (7) is the same as our original tangent equation (1).\nEXAMPLE 3 The surface F = x2 + y 2 - z2 = c is a hyperboloid.

That may be the most important formula in this chapter. Move along the tangent plane instead of the curved surface. Movements in the plane are dx and dy and dz-while Ax and Ay and Az are movements in the surface. The d's are governed by the tangent equation- the A's are governed by z =f(x, y). In Chapter 2 the d's were differentials along the tangent line:\ndy = (dy/dx)dx (straight line) and Ay,\n(dy/dx)Ax (on the curve).\n(9) Now y is independent like x. The dependent variable is z. The idea is the same. The distances x - x0 and y - yo and z - zo (on the tangent plane) are dx and dy and dz.\nThe equation of the plane is dz = (Oz/Ox) 0dx + (Oz/Oy)ody or df=fxdx +fdy.\n(10) This is the total differential. All letters dz and df and dw can be used, but Oz and Of are not used. Differentials suggest small movements in x and y; then dz is the resulting movement in z. On the tangent plane, equation (10) holds exactly.\nA \"centering transform\" has put x0, Yo, zo at the center of coordinates. Then the\n\"zoom transform\" stretches the surface into its tangent plane.\nEXAMPLE 4 The area of a triangle is A = lab sin 0.

They measure the sensitivity to change. Physically, they are the side area and base area of the cylinder. The volume differential dV comes from a shell around the side plus a layer on top:\ndV = shell + layer = 2nrh dr + rr2dh.\n(12) Starting from r = h = 1, that differential is dV= 2rndr + 7rdh. With dr = dh = .1, the shell volume is .21t and the layer volume is only .17r. So V is sensitive to dr.\nFor a short cylinder like a penny, the layer has greater volume. Vis more sensitive to dh. In our case V= rTr2h increases from n(1)3 to ~n(1.1)3 . Compare AV to dV:\nAV= n(1.1) 3 - 7(1) 3 = .3317r and dV= 27r(.1)+ 7n(.1)= .3007r.\nThe difference is AV- dV= .0317.

The mistake is of order\n(dr)2 + (dh)2.For V= 7rr 2h, the differential dV= 27rrh dr + 7rr 2dh is a linear approximation to the true change A V. We now explain that properly.\nLINEAR APPROXIMATION Tangents lead immediately to linear approximations. That is true of tangent planes as it was of tangent lines. The plane stays close to the surface, as the line stayed close to the curve. Linear functions are simpler than f(x) or f(x, y) or F(x, y, z). All we need are first derivatives at the point. Then the approximation is good near the point.\nThis key idea of calculus is already present in differentials. On the plane, df equals fxdx +fydy. On the curved surface that is a linear approximation to Af:\n43C The linear approximation to f(x, y) near the point (xo, Yo) is f(x, y) ýf(xo, Yo) + (\n(x - Xo) + ( y(y - Yo).\n(13) In other words Af fxAx +fAy, as proved in Problem 24. The right side of (13) is a linear function fL(x, y). At (xo, yo), the functions f and fL have the same slopes.\nThen f(x, y) curves away fromfL with an error of \"second order:\" If(x, y) -fL(x, Y)I < M[(x - Xo) 2 + (y - yo) 2].\n(14) This assumes thatfx,,,fx, and fy are continuous and bounded by M along the line from (xo, Yo) to (x, y). Example 3 of Section 13.5 shows that If,,I < 2M along that line.\nA factor ½ comes from equation 3.8.12, for the error f-fL with one variable.\nFor the volume of a cylinder, r and h went from 1.0 to 1.1. The second derivatives of V = lrr 2h are V,, = 27rh and Vh = 27rr and Vhh = 0. They are below M = 2.27r. Then\n(14) gives the error bound 2.27r(.1 2 + .12) = .0447r, not far above the actual error .03 17r.\nThe main point is that the error in linear approximation comes from the quadratic terms-those are the first terms to be ignored by fL.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 502, "section_id": "s0015-13pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Moving both variables, you might think dr would involve dx and dy in a square root. It doesn't. Distance involves x and y in a square root, but: change of distance is linear in Ax and Ay-to a first approximation.\nThere is a rough point at x = 0, y = 0. Any movement from (0,O) gives Ar = Jmk(Ay)2. The square root has returned. The reason is that the partial derivatives x/r and y/r are not continuous at (0,O). The cone has a sharp point with no tangent plane. Linear approximation breaks down.\nThe next example shows how to approximate Az from Ax and Ay, when the equation is F(x, y, z) = c. We use the implicit derivatives in (7) instead of the explicit derivatives in (1). The idea is the same: Look at the tangent equation as a way to find Az, instead of an equation for z. Here is Example 6 with new letters.\nEXAMPLE 7 From F = - x2 - y2 + z2 = 0 find a linear approximation to Az Solution (implicit derivatives) Use the derivatives of F: -2xAx - 2yAy + 2zAz z 0.\nThen solve for Az, which gives Az z (x/z)Ax + (y/z)Ay-the same as Example 6.\nEXAMPLE 8 How does the equilibrium price change when the supply curve changes?\nThe equilibrium price is at the intersection of the supply and demand curves\n(supply =: demand).

The new equilibrium is at Q = 60 and P = $28, where the new line XX crosses DD.\nIf the technology is expensive, the supplier will raise t when reducing s. Line YY is p = .3q + 20.

That is the starting point, around which we are finding a linear approximation. The last two equations give P, = 5013 and P, = 113 (Problem 25). The linear approximation is Comment This example turned out to be subtle (so is economics). I hesitated before including it. The equations are linear and their derivatives are easy, but something in the problem is hard-there is no explicit formula for P. The function P(s, t) is not known. Instead of a point on a surface, we are following the intersection of two lines.\nThe solution changes as the equation changes. The derivative of the solution comes from the derivative of the equation.\nSummary The foundation of this section is equation (1) for the tangent plane. Everything builds on that-total differential, linear approximation, sensitivity to small change. Later sections go on to the chain rule and \"directional derivatives\" and\n\"gradients.\" The central idea of differential calculus is Af zf,Ax +f,,Ay.\nN W O N ' S METHOD FOR MI0 EQUATIONS Linear approximation is used to solve equations. To find out where a function is zero, look first to see where its approximation is zero. To find out where a graph crosses the xy plane, look to see where its tangent plane crosses.\nRemember Newton's method for f(x) = 0. The current guess is x,. Around that point, f(x) is close to f(x,) + (x - x,)f'(x,). This is zero at the next guess x,,, = x, -f(x,)/f'(x,). That is where the tangent line crosses the x axis.\nWith two variables the idea is the samebut two unknowns x and y require two equations. We solve g(x, y) = 0 and h(x, y) = 0. Both functions have linear approximations that start from the current point (x,, y,)-where derivatives are computed:\nThe natural idea is to set these approximations to zero. That gives linear equations for x - x, and y - y,. Those are the steps Ax and Ay that take us to the next guess", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 504, "section_id": "s0015-13pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The next guess is x, = xo + Ax, yl = Yo + Ay.\nIt is of extreme interest to know which solution Newton's method will choose-if it converges at all. I made three small experiments.\n1. Suppose (xo, yo) = (2, 1). At that point g = 2 - 1 = 7 and h = 13 - 2 = -1. The derivatives are gx = 3x2 = 12, gy = - 1, hx = - 1, hy = 3y 2 = 3.

The next point is (1.1, 1.05) and convergence is clear. Soon convergence is fast.\n2. Start at (xo, Yo) = (½, 0). There we find g = 1/8 and h = - 1/2:\n(3/4)Ax - Ay= -1/8 Ax = - 1/2 x = xo +\n=Ax\n=0\n- Ax + OAy= + 1/2 Ay = + 1/4 y, = yo + Ay = - 1/4.\nNewton has jumped from (½, 0) on the x axis to (0, - f) on the y axis. The next step goes to (1/32, 0), back on the x axis. We are in the \"basin of attraction\" of (0, 0).\n3.

Convergence breaks down-the method blows up. This danger is ever-present, when we start far from a solution.\nPlease recognize that even a small computer will uncover amazing patterns. It can start from hundreds of points (xo, Yo), and follow Newton's method. Each solution has a basin of attraction, containing all (xo, Yo) leading to that solution. There is also a basin leading to infinity. The basins in Figure 13.11 are completely mixed togethera color figure shows them asfractals. The most extreme behavior is on the borderline between basins, when Newton can't decide which way to go. Frequently we see chaos.\nChaos is irregular movement that follows a definite rule. Newton's method determines an iteration from each point (x,, y,) to the next. In scientific problems it normally converges to the solution we want. (We start close enough.) But the computer makes it posible to study iterations from faraway points. This has created a new part of mathematics-so new that any experiments you do are likely to be original.\n13D Newton's method to solve g(x, y)= 0 and h(x, y)= 0 has linear equations for the steps Ax and Ay that go from (xe, yJ) to (x, + 1, y,, +1) Ax + Ay= -g(x, y.) and Ax + Ay= - h(x., yJ).\n(19) ax sy\n(ax _y _\n•/ 3D•\n• •/ • •\n/ ~ ~ t s 1 •\n• Q\n~\n~ ~ y\n•\n/ h s • ll~ a ••q a~on\n•\n••\n•\n•• //\n•\n•• '!• • •! ,i•,//•\n•\n•ii\n• i•ii••!ii ,i~~i•li,,•i!•\n,!, i •••,,ii,••i•i,•••i\n• •ii~~~ii,,!~ii iiii•,i••i••\n,,•••\n:\n•/ •\n•\n/••/\n• x i\n/ iiiiii i iii Iii i! i i iiii i\n¸\n? in:\n· _ · i\n::(/ ii", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 505, "section_id": "s0015-13pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The partial derivative dfldx treats y as constant. Similarly df/dy keeps x constant, and gives the slope in the y direction. But east-west and north-south are not the only directions to move. We could go along a 45\" line, where Ax = Ay. In principle, before we draw axes, no direction is preferred.\nThe graph is a surface with slopes in all directions.\nOn that surface, calculus looks for the rate of change (or the slope). There is a directional derivative, whatever the direction. In the 45\" case we are inclined to divide Af by Ax, but we would be wrong.\nLet me state the problem. We are given f(x, y) around a point P = (x,, yo). We are also given a direction u (a unit vector). There must be a natural definition of D,fthe derivative off in the direction u. To compute this slope at P, we need a formula.\nPreferably the formula is based on df/dx and dfldy, which we already know.\nNote that the 45\" direction has u = i/$\n+ j/$.\nThe square root of 2 is going to enter the derivative. This shows that dividing Af by Ax is wrong. We should divide by the step length As.\nEXAMPLE 1 Stay on the surface z = xy. When (x, y) moves a distance As in the 45\" direction from (1, I), what is Az/As?\nSolution The step is As times the unit vector u. Starting from x = y = 1 the step ends at x = y = 1 + AS/$.\n(The components of \"As are AS/$.) Then z = xy is r = (1 + ~ s / f i ) ~\n= 1 + $AS\n+ %As)', which means Az = $AS\n+ $(As)2.\nThe ratio AzlAs approaches fi as As + 0. That is the slope in the 45\" direction.\nDEFINITION The derivative off'in the direction u at the point P is D,f(P):\nThe step from P = (x,, yo) has length As. It takes us to (x, + ulAs, yo + u2As).

How do you compute it?\nFrom af/ax and af/ay, in two special directions, there is a quick way to find Df in all directions.

The level direction has 3u, + u2 = 0.\nThen u is proportional to (1, - 3). Changing x by 1 and y by - 3 produces no change in f= 3x + y + 1.\nIn the steepest direction u is proportional to (3, 1). Note the partial derivatives f = 3 and fy = 1. The dot product of (3, 1) and (1, -3) is zero-steepest direction is perpendicular to level direction. To make (3, 1) a unit vector, divide by 1/0.\nSteepest climb:\nD,f= 3(3/_0) + l(1//10) = 10//10 = /10 Steepest descent: Reverse to u= (-3//10, -1//10) and Df= -/10.\nThe contour lines around a mountain follow Df= 0.

The gradient vector is in the xy plane! The gradient tells which way on the surface is up, but it does that from down in the base.\nThe level curve is also in the xy plane, perpendicular to the gradient. The contour map is a projection on the base plane of what the hiker sees on the mountain.

At the point (1,2, 3), this perpendicular is N = (- 213, -413, -1). At the point (1, 2) down in the base, the gradient is (- 213, -413). The length of grad f is the slo e ,/%/3.\nProbably a hiker does not go straight up. A \"grade\" of &/3 is fairly steep (almost 150%). To estimate the slope in other directions, measure the distance along the path between two contour lines. If Af = 1 in a distance As = 3 the slope is about 113. This calculation is not exact until the limit of AflAs, which is DJ vel Fig. 13.13 N perpendicular to surface and grad f perpendicular to level line (in the base).\nEXAMPLE 4 The gradient of f(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz has three components.\nThe pattern extends from f(x, y) to f(x, y, z). The gradient is now the three-dimensional vector (j;, fy ,f,). For this function grad f is (y + z, x + z, x + y). To draw the graph of w =f(x, y, z) would require a four-dimensional picture, with axes in the xyzw directions.\nNotice: the dimensions. The graph is a 3-dimensional \"surface\" in 4-dimensional space. The gradient is down below in the 3-dimensional base. The level sets off come from xy -tyz + zx = c-they are 2-dimensional. The gradient is perpendicular to that level set (still down in 3 dimensions). The gradient is not N!

What is the derivative on a curved path? The path direction u is the tangent vector T. So replace u by T, which gives the \"direction\" of the curve.\nThe path is given by the position vector R(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j. The velocity is v =\n(dx/dt)i + (dy/dt)j. The tangent vector is T = vllvl. Notice the choice-to move at any speed (with v) or to go at unit speed (with T). There is the same choice for the derivative of.f(x, y) along this curve:\ndf afdx af dy rateofchange --(gradf)*v=--+-- dt ax dt ay dt df af dx af dy slope -=(gradf)*T=--+-- ds ax ds ay ds The first involves time. If we move faster, dfldt increases. The second involves distance.\nIf we move a distance ds, at any speed, the function changes by df. So the slope in that direction is dflds. Chapter 1 introduced velocity as dfldt and slope as dyldx and mixed them up. Finally we see the difference.\nUniform motion on a straight line has R = R, + vt. The velocity v is constant. The direction T = u = vllvl is also constant. The directional derivative is (grad f ) u, but the rate of change is (grad f ) v.\nEquations (4) and (5) look like chain rules. They are chain rules. The next section extends dfldt = (df/dx)(dx/dt) to more variables, proving (4) and (5). Here we focus on the meaning: dflds is the derivative off in the direction u = T along the curve.\nEXAMPLE 7 Find dfldt and dflds for f = r. The curve is x = t2, y = t in Figure 13.14a.\nSolution The velocity along the curve is v = 2ti + j. At the typical point t = 1 it is v = 2i + j. The unit tangent is T = v/&. The gradient is a unit vector ilfi + j/fi pointing outward, when f (x, y) is the distance r from the center. The dot product with v is dfldt = 3 / d . The dot product with T is dflds = 3 / a .\nWhen we slow down to speed 1 (with T), the changes in f(x, y) slow down too.\nEXAMPLE 8 Find dflds for f = xy along the circular path x = cos t, y = sin t.\nFirst take a direct approach. On the circle, xy equals (cos t)(sin t). Its derivative comes from the product rule: dfldt = cos2t - sin2t. Normally this is different from dflds, because the time t need not equal the arc length s. There is a speed factor dsldt to divide by-but here the speed is 1. (A circle of length s = 271 is completed at t = 2n.) Thus the slope dflds along the roller-coaster in Figure 13.14 is cos2t - sin2t.\nA D = distance to (xo, yo) Fig. 13.14 The distance f = r changes along the curve.

Their dot product is the same dflds:\nslope along path = (grad f ) T = - sin2t + cos2t.\nGRADIENTS WITHOUT COORDINAJES This section ends with a little \"philosophy.\" What is the coordinate-free dejnition of the gradient? Up to now, grad f = (fx, f,,) depended totally on the choice of x and y axes. But the steepness of a surface is independent of the axes. Those are added later, to help us compute.\nThe steepness dflds involves only f and the direction, nothing else. The gradient should be a \"tensorw-its meaning does not depend on the coordinate system. The gradient has different formulas in different systems (xy or re or . . .), but the direction and length of grad f are determined by dflds-without any axes:\nThe drrection of grad f is the one in which dflds is largest.\nThe length Igrad f 1 is that largest slope.\nThe key equation is (change in f) x (gradient off) (change in position). That is another way to write Af x fxAx +@y. It is the multivariable form-we used two variablesof the basic linear approximation Ay x (dy/dx)Ax.\nEXAMPLE 9 D(x, y) = distance from (x, y) to (x,, yo).

The graph of D(x, y) is a cone with slope 1 and sharp point (x,, yo).\nFirst question In which direction does the distance D(x, y) increase fastest?\nAnswer Going directly away from (x,, yo). Therefore this is the direction of grad D.\nSecond question How quickly does D increase in that steepest direction?\n~nswer A step of length As increases D by As. Therefore ]grad Dl = AslAs = 1.\nConclusion grad D is a unit vector. The derivatives of D in Problem 48 are\n(x - xo)/D and (y - yo)/D.

The first is \"application,\" the second looks like \"theory.\" If we minimize f to save time or money or energy, that is an application. If we don't take derivatives to find the minimum-maybe because f is a function of other functions, and we don't have a chain rule-then it is time for more theory. The chain rule is a fundamental working tool, because f(g(x)) appears all the time in applications. So do f(g(x, y)) and f(x(t), y(t)) and worse. We have to know their derivatives. Otherwise calculus can't continue with the applications.\nYou may instinctively say: Don't bother with the theory, just teach me the formulas.\nThat is not possible. You now regard the derivative of sin 2x as a trivial problem, unworthy of an answer. That was not always so. Before the chain rule, the slopes of sin 2x and sin x2 and sin2x2 were hard to compute from Af/Ax. We are now at the same point for f(x, y). We know the meaning of dfldx, but iff = r tan B and x = r cos 8 and y = r sin 8, we need a way to compute afldx. A little theory is unavoidable, if the problem-solving part of calculus is to keep going.\nTo repeat: The chain rule applies to a function of a function. In one variable that was f(g(x)). With two variables there are more possibilities:\n1. f ( ~ ) withz=g(x,y) Find df/dx and afldy 2. f(x, y) with x = x(t), y = y(t) Find dfldt 3. f(x, y) with x = x(t, u), y = y(t, u) Find dfldt and afldu", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 515, "section_id": "s0015-13pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

More exactly, the input derivatives like ag/ax and dxldt and dx/au are continuous. Then the output derivatives like af/ax and dfldt and df/au will be continuous from the chain rule. We avoid points like r =0 in polar coordinates-where ar/dx =x/r has a division by zero.\nA Typical Problem Start with a function of x and y, for example x times y. Thus f(x, y) = xy. Change x to r cos 8 and y to r sin 8. The function becomes (rcos 8)times\n(r sin 8). We want its derivatives with respect to r and 8. First we have to decide on its name.\nTo be correct, we should not reuse the letter5 The new function can be F:\nf(x, y) =xy f(r cos 8, r sin 8)=(r cos 8)(rsin 8)= F(r, 8).\nWhy not call it f(r, 8)? Because strictly speaking that is r times 8! If we follow the rules, then f(x, y) is xy and f(r, 8) should be re. The new function F does the right thing-it multiplies (r cos 8)(rsin 8). But in many cases, the rules get bent and the letter F is changed back to 5 This crime has already occurred. The end of the last page ought to say dFlat.\nInstead the printer put dfldt. The purpose of the chain rule is to find derivatives in the new variables t and u (or r and 8). In our example we want the derivative of F with respect to r.

The independent variable was time or space (and only one dimension in space). For partial differential equations the variables are time and space (possibly several dimensions in space). The great equations of mathematical physics-heat equation, wave equation, Laplace's equation-are partial differential equations.\nNotice how the chain rule applies to f = sin xy. Its x derivative is y cos xy. A patient reader would check that f is sing and g is xy and f, is &g,. Probably you are not so patient-you know the derivative of sin xy. Therefore we pass quickly to the next chain rule. Its outside function depends on two inside functions, and each of those depends on t. We want dfldt.\nTHE DERIVATIVE OF f(x(t), y(t)) Before the formula, here is the idea. Suppose t changes by At. That affects x and y;\nthey change by Ax and Ay.

Now At affects Af in two ways, through x and through y. The chain rule has two terms. If we cancel in (af/ax)(dx/dt) we only get one of the terms!\nWe mention again that the true name for f(x(t), y(t)) is F(t) not f(t). For f(x, y, z) the rule has three terms: fxx, +fyyt +fiz, isf, (or better dF/dt).\nEXAMPLE 2 How quickly does the temperature change when you drive to Florida?\nSuppose the Midwest is at 30°F and Florida is at 80°F. Going 1000 miles south increases the temperature f(x, y) by 50°, or .05 degrees per mile. Driving straight south at 70 miles per hour, the rate of increase is (.05)(70) = 3.5 degrees per hour. Note how\n(degreeslmile) times (miles/hour)equals (degrees/hour).

The chain rule for af/& is no surprise:\naf ax af ay 131 Chain rule for f(x(t, u), y(t, u)): -af = --+-- at ax at ay at'\n(7) This rule has a/at instead of dldt, because of the extra variable u. The symbols remind us that u is constant. Similarly t is constant while u moves, and there is a second chain rule for aflau:\nfu =fxxu +f,yu.\nEXAMPLE 4 In polar coordinates findf, andf,,.

In mathematics, a messy formula is almost always a signal of asking the wrong question. In fact the combination f,, +f,, is much more special thian the separate derivatives. We might hope the same forf,, +f,,, but dimensionally that is impossible-since r is a length and 8 is an angle. The dimensions of f,, andf,, are matched byf,, andf,/r and f,,/r2.

Laplace's equation fxx +&, = 0 is now expressed in polar coordinates: f,, +f,/r +f,,/r2 = 0.\nA PARADOX Before leiaving polar coordinates there is one more question. It goes back to drldx, which wals practically the first example of partial derivatives:\nMy problem is this. We know that x is r cos 8. So x/r on the right side is cos 8. On the other hand r is xlcos 8. So &-/ax is also l/cos 8. How can drldx lead to cos 8 one way and l/cos 8 the other way?\nI will admit that this cost me a sleepless night. There must be an explanationwe cannot end with cos 8 = l/cos 8. This paradox brings a new respect for partial derivatives. May I tell you what I finally noticed? You could cover up the next paragraph and think about the puzzle first.\nThe key to partial derivatives is to ask: Which variable is held constant? In equation (1 1), y is constant. But when r = xlcos 8 gave &/ax = l/cos 8,8 was constant.\nIn both cases we change x and look at the effect on r. The movement is on a horizontal line (constant y) or on a radial line (constant 8). Figure 13.15 shows the difference.\nRemark This example shows that drldx is different from l/(dx/ar). The neat formula\n(dr/dx)(dx/dr)= 1 is not generally true. May I tell you what takes its place? We have to includle (dr/dy)(ay/dr). With two variables xy and two variables re, we need 2 by 2 matrices!

In computing partial derivatives off(x, y, z), we assumed that x, y, z were independent. Up to now, x could move while y and z were fixed. In physics and chemistry and economics that may not be possible. If there is a relation between x, y, z, then x can't move by itself.\nEXAMPLE 5 The gas law PV = nRT relates pressure to volume and temperature.\nP, V, T are not independent. What is the meaning of dV/aP? Does it equal l/(dP/aV)?\nThose questions have no answers, until we say what is held constant. In the paradox,\n&/ax had one meaning for fixed y and another meaning for fixed 8. To inrlicate what is held constant, use an extra subscript (not denoting a derivative):\n(af/aP), has constant volume and (af/aP), has constant temperature. The usual af/dP has both V and T constant. But then the gas law won't let us change P.\nEXAMPLE 6 Let f = 3x + 2y + Z. Compute af/ax on the plane z = 4x + y.\nSolution 1 Think of x and y as independent. Replace z by 4x + y:\nf = 3x + 2~ + ( 4 ~+ y) so (af/ax), = 7.\nSolution 2 Keep x and y independent. Deal with z by the chain rule:\n(aflax), = aflax + (aflaz)(az/ax)= 3 + (I)(+ = 7.\nSolution 3 (di$evnt) Make x and z independent. Then y = z - 4x:\nWithout a subscript, af/ax means: Take the x derivative the usual way. The answer is af/ax = 3, when y and z don't move. But on the plane z = 4x + y, one of them must move! 3 is only part of the total answer, which is (aflax), = 7 or (af/ax), = -5.\nHere is the geometrical meaning. We are on the plane z = 4x + y. The derivative\n(afldx),, moves x but not y. To stay on the plane, dz is 4dx. The change in f = 3 ~ + 2 y + z i s d f = 3 d x + O + d z = 7 d x .\nEXAMPLE 7 On the world line x2 + y2 + z2= t2 find (af/dy),,, for f= xyzt.\nThe subscripts x, z mean that x and z are fixed.

The slope is zero and the tangent line is horizontal. Most likely we are at the top or bottom of the graph-a maximum or a minimum. This is the point that the engineer or manager or scientist or investor is looking for-maximum stress or production or velocity or profit. With more variables in f(x, y) and f(x, y, z), the problem becomes more realistic. The question still is: How to locate the maximum and minimum?\nThe answer is in the partial derivatives. When the graph is level, they are zero.\nDeriving the equations f, = 0 and f,= 0 is pure mathematics and pure pleasure.\nApplying them is the serious part. We watch out for saddle points, and also for a minimum at a boundary point-this section takes extra time. Remember the steps for f(x) in one-variable calculus:\n1. The leading candidates are stationary points (where dfldx = 0).\n2. The other candidates are rough points (no derivative) and endpoints (a or b).\n3. Maximum vs. minimum is decided by the sign of the second derivative.\nIn two dimensions, a stationary point requires af/dx = 0 and df/ay = 0. The tangent line becomes a tangent plane. The endpoints a and b are replaced by a boundary curve.

This may be an absolute minimum or only a local minimum. In both casesf(xo, yo) <f(x, y) near the point. For an absolute minimum, this inequality holds wherever f is defined. For a local minimum, the inequality can fail far away from (xo, yo). The bottom of your foot is an absolute minimum, the end of your finger is a local minimum.\nWe assume for now that (xo, Yo) is an interior point of the domain off. At a boundary point, we cannot expect a horizontal tangent and zero derivatives.\nMain conclusion: At a minimum or maximum (absolute or local) a nonzero derivative is impossible. The tangent plane would tilt. In some direction f would decrease.\nNote that the minimum point is (xo, yo), and the minimum value is f(xo, yo).\n13J If derivatives exist at an interior minimum or maximum, they are zero:\nOf/lx = 0 and Oflay = 0\n(together this is grad f= 0).\n(1) For a function f(x, y, z) of three variables, add the third equation af/az = 0.\nThe reasoning goes back to the one-variable case. That is because we look along the lines x = x0 and y = Yo. The minimum off(x, y) is at the point where the lines meet.\nSo this is also the minimum along each line separately.\nMoving in the x direction along y = yo, we find Of/Ox = 0. Moving in the y direction, Of/Oy = 0 at the same point. The slope in every direction is zero. In other words grad f= 0.\nGraphically, (xo, Yo) is the low point of the surface z =f(x, y).

The roads could go anywhere. But most applications have restrictions on x and y, like x 3 0 or y d 0 or x2 + y2 2 1. The minimum with these restrictions is probably higher than the absolute minimum. There are three possibilities:\n(1) stationary point fx = 0, fy = 0\n(2) rough point\n(3) boundary point That third possibility requires us to maximize or minimize f(x, y) along the boundary.\nEXAMPLE 3 Minimize f(x, y) = x2 + xy + y2 - x - y + 1 in the halfplane x 2 0.\nThe minimum in Example 1 was 3. It occurred at x, = 3, yo = 3. This point is still allowed. It satisfies the restriction x 3 0. So the minimum is not moved.\nEXAMPLE 4 Minimize the same f(x, y) restricted to the lower halfplane y < 0.\nNow the absolute minimum at (3, i)is not allowed. There are no rough points. We look for a minimum on the boundary line y = 0 in Figure 13.19a. Set y = 0, so f depends only on x. Then choose the best x:\nf(x, 0) = x2 + 0 - x - 0 + 1 and fx = 2x - 1 = 0.\nThe minimum is at x = and y = 0, where f = 2. This is up from 5.\nFig. 13.19 The boundaries y = 0 and x2 + y2 = 1 contain the minimum points.\nEXAMPLE 5 Minimize the same f(x, y) on or outside the circle x2 + y2 = 1.\nOne possibility is fx = 0 and f,,= 0. But this is at (i, k), inside the circle. The other possibility is a minimum at a boundary point, on the circle.\nTo follow this boundary we can set y = Jm.\nThe function f gets complicated, and dfldx is worse. There is a way to avoid square roots: Set x = cos t and y = sin t.\nThen f = x2 + xy + y2 - x - y + 1 is a function of the angle t:\nf(t) = 1 + cos t sin t - cos t - sin t + 1 dfldt = cos2t- sin2t+ sin t - cos t = (cos t - sin t)(cos t + sin t - 1).\nNow dfldt = 0 locates a minimum or maximum along the boundary. The first factor\n(cos t - sin t ) is zero when x = y. The second factor is zero when cos t + sin t = 1, or x + y = 1. Those points on the circle are the candidates. Problem 24 sorts them out, and Section 13.7 finds the minimum in a new way-using\n\"Lagrange multipliers.\"", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 526, "section_id": "s0015-13pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

When possible, try all candidates and decide. Computef at every stationary point and other critical point (maybe also out at infinity), and compare. Calculus offers another approach, based on second derivatives.\nWith one variable the second derivative test was simple: fxx > 0 at a minimum, fxx = 0 at an inflection point, fxx < 0 at a maximum. This is a local test, which may not give a global answer. But it decides whether the slope is increasing (bottom of the graph) or decreasing (top of the graph). We now find a similar test for f(x, y).\nThe new test involves all three second derivatives. It applies where fx = 0 and f, = 0. The tangent plane is horizontal. We ask whether the graph off goes above or below that plane. The tests fxx > 0 and fy, > 0 guarantee a minimum in the x and y directions, but there are other directions.\nEXAMPLE 6 f(x, y) = x2 + lOxy + y2 has fxx = 2, fx = 10, fyy, = 2 (minimum or not?) All second derivatives are positive-but wait and see. The stationary point is (0, 0), where af/ax and aflay are both zero. Our function is the sum of x2 + y2, which goes upward, and 10xy which has a saddle. The second derivatives must decide whether x2 + y2 or lOxy is stronger.\nAlong the x axis, where y = 0 and f= x2, our point is at the bottom. The minimum in the x direction is at (0, 0). Similarly for the y direction. But (0, 0) is not a minimum point for the whole function, because of lOxy.\nTry x = 1, y = - 1. Then f= 1 - 10 + 1, which is negative. The graph goes below the xy plane in that direction.

The second derivatives 2, 1, 2 are again positive. The graph curves up in the x and y directions. But there is a big difference from Example 6: fx, is reduced from 10 to 1.\nIt is the size of fx (not its sign!) that makes the difference. The extra terms - x - y + 4 in Example 1 moved the stationary point to (-, -). The second derivatives are still 2, 1, 2, and they pass the test for a minimum:\n13K At (0, 0) the quadratic function f(x, y)= ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 has a a>0 a<0 ac > b2 ac > b2 509", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 527, "section_id": "s0015-13pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

So does - x 2 + xy - y2 Now comes the final step, from ax 2 + 2bxy + cy 2 to a general functionf(x, y). For all functions, quadratics or not, it is the second order terms that we test.\nEXAMPLE 8 f(x, y) = ex - x - cos y has a stationary point at x = 0, y = 0.\nThe first derivatives are ex - 1 and sin y, both zero. The second derivatives are fxx ex = 1 and fry = cos y = 1 and fxy = 0. We only use the derivatives at the stationary point. The first derivatives are zero, so the second order terms come to the front in the series for ex - x - cos y:\n(1\n+ x + ½x2 ...\n_ 2\n...\n2 2\n+ higher order terms.\n(7) There is a minimum at the origin. The quadratic part ½x2 + ½y 2 goes upward. The x3 and y4 terms are too small to protest. Eventually those terms get large, but near a stationary point it is the quadratic that counts. We didn't need the whole series, because from fxx =f,, = 1 and fxy = 0 we knew it would start with ½x 2 + ½y2.\n13L The test in 43K applies to the second derivatives a =fxx, b =fx,, c =fy of any f(x, y) at any stationary point. At all points the test decides whether the graph is concave up, concave down, or \"indefinite.\" EXAMPLE 9 f(x, y) = exy has fx = yexy and f, = xexy. The stationary point is (0, 0).\nThe second derivatives at that point are a =fxx = 0, b =fxy = 1, and c =fy, = 0. The test b2 > ac makes this a saddle point.

The graph is concave up at that pointbut it's not a minimum since the first derivatives are not zero.\nThe series begins with the constant term-not important. Then come the linear terms-extremely important. Those terms are decided by first derivatives, and they give the tangent plane. It is only at stationary points-when the linear part disappears and the tangent plane is horizontal-that second derivatives take over.

It is a \"Taylor series\"-which means it is a power series that matches all derivatives off (at the basepoint). For one variable, the powers were x\" when the basepoint was 0. For two variables, the powers are x\" times y' when the basepoint is (0, 0). Chapter 10 multiplied the nth derivative d\"f/dx n by xl/n! Now every mixed derivative (d/dx)\"(d/8y)mf(x, y) is computed at the basepoint (subscript o).\nWe multiply those numbers by x\"ym/n!m! to match each derivative of f(x, y):\nThe first three terms are the linear approximation to f(x, y). They give the tangent plane at the basepoint. The x2 term has n = 2 and m = 0, so n!m! = 2. The xy term has n = m = 1, and n!m! = 1. The quadratic part -ax 2 + 2bxy + cy2) is in control when the linear part is zero.\nEXAMPLE 10 All derivatives of ex+Y equal one at the origin. The Taylor series is x2 y2 nm ex +Y= 1 +x\n+ -\n+ xy+ -\n+ 2 2 n!m!\nThis happens to have ac = b2, the special case that was omitted in 13M and 43N.\nIt is the two-dimensional version of an inflection point. The second derivatives fail to decide the concavity. When fxxfy, = (fxy) 2, the decision is passed up to the higher derivatives. But in ordinary practice, the Taylor series is stopped after the quadratics.\nIf the basepoint moves to (xo, Yo), the powers become (x - xo)\"(y - yo)m\"-and all derivatives are computed at this new basepoint.\nFinal question: How would you compute a minimum numerically? One good way is to solve fx = 0 and fy = 0. These are the functions g and h of Newton's method\n(Section 13.3). At the current point (x,, yn), the derivatives of g =fx and h =f, give linear equations for the steps Ax and Ay. Then the next point x,. 1 = x, + Ax, y,, + = y, + Ay comes from those steps. The input is (x,, y,), the output is the new point, and the linear equations are\n(gx)Ax + (gy)Ay = - g(xn, y,)\n(fxx)Ax + (fxy)Ay = -fx(xn, y,,) or\n(5)\n(hx)Ax + (hy)Ay = - h(x,, y,)\n(fxy)Ax + (fyy)Ay = -fy(Xn, y,).\nWhen the second derivatives of f are available, use Newton's method.\nWhen the problem is too complicated to go beyond first derivatives, here is an alternative-steepest descent. The goal is to move down the graph of f(x, y), like a boulder rolling down a mountain. The steepest direction at any point is given by the gradient, with a minus sign to go down instead of up. So move in the direction Ax =\n- s af/ax and Ay = - s aflay.\n13M When the basepoint is (0, 0), the Taylor series is a double sum 1ya,,mxp.\nThe term anmxnym has the same mixed derivative at (0, 0) asf(x, y).

We often minimize one function f(x, y) while another function g(x, y) is fixed. There is a constraint on x and y, given by g(x, y) = k. This restricts the material available or the funds available or the energy available. With this constraint, the problem is to do the best possible (f,, or fmin).\nAt the absolute minimum off(x, y), the requirement g(x, y) = k is probably violated.\nIn that case the minimum point is not allowed. We cannot use f, = 0 and f,,= Othose equations don't account for g.\nStep 1 Find equations for the constrained minimum or constrained maximum. They will involve f, andf,, and also g, and g,, which give local information about f and g.\nTo see the equations, look at two examples.\nEXAMPLE 1 Minimizef = x2 + y2 subject to the constraint g = 2x + y = k.\nTrial runs The constraint allows x = 0, y = k, where f = k2. Also ($k, 0) satisfies the constraint, and f = $k2 is smaller. Also x = y = $k gives f = $k2 (best so far).\nIdea of solution Look at the level curves of f(x, y) in Figure 13.21. They are circles x2 + y2 = C. When c is small, the circles do not touch the line 2x + y = k. There are no points that satisfy the constraint, when c is too small. Now increase c.\nEventually the growing circles x2 + y2 = c will just touch the line x + 2y = k. The point where they touch is the winner. It gives the smallest value of c that can be achieved on the line. The touching point is (xmin, ymi,), and the value of c is fmin.\nWhat equation describes that point? When the circle touches the line, they are tangent. They have the same slope. The perpendiculars to the circle and he line go in the same direction. That is the key fact, which you see in Figure 13.21a.The direction perpendicular to f = c is given by grad f = (f,, f,). The direction perpendicular to g = k is given by grad g = (g,, g,).

That largest value of c is f,,, .\nThe minimum and maximum are described by the same rule: the circle is tangent to the ellipse (Figure 13.21b). The perpendiculars go in the same direction. Therefore\n(fx, 4)is a multiple of (g,, gy), and the unknown multiplier is A:\nSolution The second equation allows two possibilities: y = 0 or A = a. Following up y = 0, the last equation gives (x - 1)' = 4. Thus x = 3 or x = - 1. Then the first equation gives A = 312 or A = 112. The values of f are x2 + y2 = 3' + 0' = 9 and\n~ ~ + ~ ~ = ( - 1 ) ~ + 0 ~ = 1.\nNow follow A = 114. The first equation yields x = - 113. Then the last equation requires y2 = 5/9. Since x2 = 119 we find x2 + y2 = 619 = 213. This is f,,,.\nConclusion The equations (3) have four solutions, at which the circle and ellipse are tangent. The four points are (3, O), (- 1, O), (- 113, &3), and (- 113, -&3).\nThe four values off are 9, 1,3,3.\nSummary The three equations are fx = Agx and fy = Ag,, and g = k. The unknowns are x, y, and A. There is no absolute system for solving the equations (unless they are linear; then use elimination or Cramer's Rule). Often the first two equations yield x and y in terms of A, and substituting into g = k gives an equation for A.\nAt the minimum, the level curve f(x, y) = c is tangent to the constraint curve g(x, y) = k.

Its applications to business decisions make up operations research. The special case of linear functions is always important -in this part of mathematics it is called linear programming.

The constraints are g(x, y, z) = k, and h(x, y, z) = k,. The multipliers are A, and A,.

First, a double integral is defined as the limit of sums. Second, we find a fast way to compute it. The key idea is to replace a double integral by two ordinary \"single\" integrals.\nThe double integral Sf f(x, y)dy dx starts with 1f(x, y)dy. For each fixed x we integrate with respect to y. The answer depends on x. Now integrate again, this time with respect to x. The limits of integration need care and attention! Frequently those limits on y and x are the hardest part.\nWhy bother with sums and limits in the first place? Two reasons. There has to be a definition and a computation to fall back on, when the single integrals are difficult or impossible. And also-this we emphasize-multiple integrals represent more than area and volume. Those words and the pictures that go with them are the easiest to understand. You can almost see the volume as a \"sum of slices\" or a \"double sum of thin sticks.\" The true applications are mostly to other things, but the central idea is always the same: Add up small pieces and take limits.\nWe begin with the area of R and the volume of by double integrals.\nA LIMIT OF SUMS The graph of z =f(x, y) is a curved surface above the xy plane. At the point (x, y) in the plane, the height of the surface is z. (The surface is above the xy plane only when z is positive. Volumes below the plane come with minus signs, like areas below the x axis.) We begin by choosing a positive function-for example z = 1+ x2 + y2.\nThe base of our solid is a region R in the xy plane. That region will be chopped into small rectangles (sides Ax and Ay). When R itself is the rectangle 0d x < 1, 0< y < 2, the small pieces fit perfectly. For a triangle or a circle, the rectangles miss part of R. But they do fit in the limit, and any region with a piecewise smooth boundary will be acceptable.\nQuestion What is the volume above R and below the graph of z =Ax, y)?\nAnswer It is a double integral-the integral of f(x, y) over R. To reach it we begin with a sum, as suggested by Figure 14.1.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 540, "section_id": "s0016-14pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Solid V cut into thin sticks AV = z A A.\nFor single integrals, the interval [a, b] is divided into short pieces of length Ax.\nFor double integrals, R is divided into small rectangles of area AA = (Ax)(Ay). Above the ith rectangle is a \"thin stick\" with small volume. That volume is the base area AA times the height above it-except that this height z =f(x, y) varies from point to point. Therefore we select a point (xi, y,) in the ith rectangle, and compute the volume from the height above that point:\nvolume of one stick =f(xi, yi)AA volume of all sticks = 1f(xi, yi)AA.\nThis is the crucial step for any integral-to see it as a sum of small pieces.\nNow take limits: Ax -+ 0 and Ay -+ 0. The height z =f(x, y) is nearly constant over each rectangle. (We assume that f is a continuous function.) The sum approaches a limit, which depends only on the base R and the surface above it. The limit is the volume of the solid, and it is the double integral of f(x, y) over R:\nJ JR f(x, y) dA = lim 1f(xi, yi)AA.\nA x -t 0 Ay+O To repeat: The limit is the same for all choices of the rectangles and the points (xi, yi).\nThe rectangles will not fit exactly into R, if that base area is curved. The heights are not exact, if the surface z =f(x, y) is also curved. But the errors on the sides and top, where the pieces don't fit and the heights are wrong, approach zero. Those errors are the volume of the \"icing\" around the solid, which gets thinner as Ax -+ 0 and Ay -+ 0.\nA careful proof takes more space than we are willing to give. But the properties of the integral need and deserve attention:\n1. Linearity: jj(f + g)dA = jj f d~ + jjg dA 2. Constant comes outside: jj cf(x, y)dA = c jj f(x, y)dA 3. R splits into S and T(not overlapping): ]jf d~ = jj f d\n~+ jj f d ~ .\nR S T In 1 the volume under f + g has two parts. The \"thin sticks\" of height f + g split into thin sticks under f and under g. In 2 the whole volume is stretched upward by c. In 3 the volumes are side by side. As with single integrals, these properties help in computations.\nBy writing dA, we allow shapes other than rectangles. Polar coordinates have an extra factor r in dA = r dr do.

(Or vice versa. Our first integral could equally well be ff(x, y)dx.) Chapter 8 described the same idea for solids of revolution. First came the area of a slice, which is a single integral. Then came a second integral to add up the slices. For solids formed by revolving a curve, all slices are circular disks-now we expect other shapes.\nFigure 14.2 shows a slice of area A(x). It cuts through the solid at a fixed value of x. The cut starts at y = c on one side of R, and ends at y = d on the other side. This particular example goes from y = 0 to y = 2 (R is a rectangle). The area of a slice is the y integral of f(x, y).

We are leaving the xy variables where dA = dx dy.\nThe reason for changing is this: The limits of integration in the y direction are miserable. I don't know them and I don't want to know them. For every x we would need the entry point P of the line x = constant, and the exit point Q. The heights of P and Q are the limits on Jdy, the inner integral. The geometry of the square and ring are totally missed, if we stick rigidly to x and y.\nFig. 14.5 Unit square turned through angle a. Ring with radii 4 and 5.\nWhich coordinates are better? Any sensible person agrees that the area of the tilted square is 1. \"Just turn it and the area is obvious.\" But that sensible person may not know the moment or the center of gravity or the moment of inertia. So we actually have to do the turning.\nThe new coordinates u and v are in Figure 14.6a. The limits of integration on v are 0 and 1. So are the limits on u. But when you change variables, you don't just change limits. Two other changes come with new variables:\n1. The small area dA = dx dy becomes dA = du dv.\n2. The integral of x becomes the integral of\n.\nSubstituting u = in a single integral, we make the same changes. Limits x = 0 and x = 4 become u = 0 and u = 2. Since x is u2, dx is 2u du. The purpose of the change is to find an antiderivative. For double integrals, the usual purpose is to improve the limits-but we have to accept the whole package.\nTo turn the square, there are formulas connecting x and y to u and 1.1. The geometry is clear-rotate axes by x-but it has to be converted into algebra:\nu = s cos x + j. sin x x = u cos x - c sin x r = -s sin x + j9cos x and in reverse y = u sin x + c cos X.\n(1) Figure 14.6 shows the rotation. As points move, the whole square turns. A good way to remember equation (1) is to follow the corners as they become (1,O) and (0, 1).\nThe change from JJ x dA to Jl du dl: is partly decided by equation (1). It gives x as a function of u and v. We also need dA. For a pure rotation the first guess is correct: The area dx dy equals the area du dv. For most changes of variable this is false.

Where we have dx, we write (dx/du)du.Where we have (du/dx)dx,we write du. That was the idea of substitutions-the main way to simplify integrals.\nFor double integrals the stretching factor appears in the area: dx dy becomes IJI du do. The old and new variables are related by x = x(u, v) and y = y(u, 0). The point with coordinates u and v comes from the point with coordinates x and y. A whole region S, full of points in the uu plane, comes from the region R full of corresponding points in the xy plane. A small piece with area IJI du dv comes from a small piece with area dx dy. The formula for J is a two-dimensional version of dxldu.\n1 148 The stretching factor for area is the 2 by 2 Jacobian dktermiccnf J(u, v):\nI An integral over R in the xy plane becomes an integral over S in the uv plane:\nThe determinant J is often written a(x, y)/d(u, v), as a reminder that this stretching factor is like dxldu.

The reason is in the limits of integration.\nThe single integral dx is '(- du) after changing x to -u. We keep the minus sign and allow single integrals to run backward. Double integrals could too, but normally they go left to right and down to up. We use the absolute value IJI and run forward.\nEXAMPLE 6 Polar coordinates have x = u cos v = r cos 6 and y = u sin v = r sin 8.\ncos 6 - r sin 8 With no geometry:\n= r .\n(10) sin 8 r cos 8", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 551, "section_id": "s0016-14pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

You can guess what triple integrals are like. Instead of a small interval or a small rectangle, there is a small box.\nInstead of length dx or area dx dy, the box has volume dV= dx dy dz. That is length times width times height. The goal is to put small boxes together (by integration).\nThe main problem will be to discover the correct limits on x, y, z.\nWe could dream up more and more complicated regions in three-dimensional space. But I don't think you can see the method clearly without seeing the region clearly. In practice six shapes are the most important:\nbox prism cylinder cone tetrahedron sphere.\nThe box is easiest and the sphere may be the hardest (but no problem in spherical coordinates). Circular cylinders and cones fall in the middle, where xyz coordinates are possible but rOz are the best. I start with the box and prism and xyz.\nEXAMPLE 1 By triple integrals find the volume of a box and a prism (Figure 14.12).\n1 3 2 1 3 -3z 2 JJ dV= j f f dx dy dz and ff dV= j l dx dy dz box z=0 y=O x=O prism z=0 y=O x=0 The inner integral for both is S dx = 2. Lines in the x direction have length 2, cutting through the box and the prism. The middle integrals show the limits on y (since dy comes second):\n3 3-3z f 2dy=6 and S 2dy=6-6z.\ny=- y=- After two integrations these are areas. The first area 6 is for a plane section through the box. The second area 6 - 6z is cut through the prism. The shaded rectangle goes from y = 0 to y = 3 - 3z-we needed and used the equation y + 3z = 3 for the boundary of the prism. At this point z is still constant! But the area depends on z, because the prism gets thinner going upwards. The base area is 6 - 6z = 6, the top area is 6 - 6z = 0.\nThe outer integral multiplies those areas by dz, to give the volume of slices. They are horizontal slices because z came last. Integration adds up the slices to find the total volume:\nbox volume = 6 dz = 6 prism volume=\n(66z)dz = 6z - 3z2]\n=3.\nz=0 z=0 The box volume 2 3 - 1 didn't need calculus.

It enters the prism at z = 0 and exits at the sloping face y + 32 = 3. That gives the upper limit z = (3 -y)/3. It is the height of a thin stick as in Section 14.1. This section writes out j dz for the height, but a quicker solution starts at the double integral.\nWhat is the number 1 in the last integral? It is the area of a vertical slice, cut by a plane x = constant. The outer integral adds up slices.\nx, y, z) dV is computed from three single integrals That step cannot be taken in silence-some basic calculus is involved. The triple integral is the limit of xfiAV, a sum over small boxes of volume AV. Herefi is any value of f(x, y, z) in the ith box. (In the limit, the boxes fit a curved region.) Now take those boxes in a certain order. Put them into lines in the x direction and put the lines of boxes into planes. The lines lead to the inner x integral, whose answer depends on y and z. The y integral combines the lines into planes. Finally the outer integral accounts for all planes and all boxes.\nExample 2 is important because it displays more possibilities than a box or prism.\nEXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of a tetrahedron (4-sided pyramid). Locate (2,j,5).\nSolution A tetrahedron has four flat faces, all triangles. The fourth face in Figure 14.13 is on the plane x + y + z = 1. A line in the x direction enters at x = 0 and exits at x = 1 - y - z. (The length depends on y and z. The equation of the boundary plane gives x.) Then those lines are put into plane slices by the y integral:\nWhat is this number i(1 - z ) ~ ?It is the area at height z. The plane at that height slices out a right triangle, whose legs have length 1 -z. The area is correct, but look at the limits of integration. If x goes to 1 - y - z, why does y go to 1 - z? Reason:\nWe are assembling lines, not points. The figure shows a line at every y up to 1 - z.\nFig. 14.13 Lines end at plane x + y + z = 1. Triangles end at edge y + z = 1.

If a needle goes through the sphere in the x direction, where does it enter and leave? Moving in the x direction, the numbers y and z stay constant. The inner integral deals only with x. The smallest and largest x are at the boundary where x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. This equation does the work-we solve it for x. Look at the limits on the x integral:\nThe limits on y are -d m and +,/-.\nYou can use algebra on the boundary equation x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. But notice that x is gone! We want the smallest and largest y, for each z. It helps very much to draw the plane at height z, slicing through the sphere in Figure 14.14. The slice is a circle of radius r = ,/=.\nSo the area is xr2, which must come from the y integral:\nI admit that I didn't integrate. Is it cheating to use the formula xr2? I don't think so.\nMathematics is hard enough, and we don't have to work blindfolded. The goal is understanding, and if you know the area then use it. Of course the integral of Jw can be done if necessary-use Section 7.2.\nThe triple integral is down to a single integral.

The solid is three-dimensional, so there are three coordinates r, 0, z:\nr: out from the axis 0: around the axis z: along the axis.\nThis is a mixture of polar coordinates rO in a plane, plus z upward. You will not find rOz difficult to work with.

Or a tetrahedron.\nThe integral needs one thing more-the volume dV. The movements dr and dO and dz give a \"curved box\" in xyz space, drawn in Figure 14.15c. The base is a polar rectangle, with area r dr dO. The new part is the height dz. The volume of the curved box is r dr dO dz.

Since z goes up to 1 - r, and 8 goes around to 2n, those integrals produce jj r dz d8 = r(l - r)2n. Stop again-this must be the area of something.\nAfter the z and 8 integrals we have a shell at radius r. The height is 1 - r (the outer shells are shorter). This height times 2nr gives the area around the shell. The choice betweeen shells and slices is exactly as in Chapter 8. Diflerent orders of integration give dfferent ways to cut up the solid.\nThe volume of the shell is area times thickness dr. The volume of the complete cone is the integral of shell volumes: 1; r(1 - r)2n dr = 43.\nThird solution Do the r and z integrals first: jj r dr dz = A. Then the 8 integral is 1 dB, which gives times 2n. This is the volume n/3-but what is & dB?\nThe third cone is cut into wedges. The volume of a wedge is & dB.

Forget the p integral:\nAfter those examples from geometry, here is the real thing from science. I want to compute one of the most important triple integrals in physics-\"the gravitational attraction of a solid sphere.\" For some reason Isaac Newton had trouble with this integral. He refused to publish his masterpiece on astronomy until he had solved it.\nI think he didn't use spherical coordinates-and the integral is not easy even now.\nThe answer that Newton finally found is beautiful. The sphere acts as if all its mass were concentrated at the center. At an outside point (O,0, D), the force of gravity is proportional to 1/D2. The force from a uniform solid sphere equals the force from a point mass, at every outside point P. That is exactly what Newton wanted and needed, to explain the solar system and to prove Kepler's laws.\nHere is the difficulty. Some parts of the sphere are closer than D, some parts are farther away. The actual distance q, from the outside point P to a typical inside point, is shown in Figure 14.18. The average distance q to all points in the sphere is not D.\nBut what Newton needed was a different average, and by good luck or some divine calculus it works perfectly: The average of l/q is 1/D. This gives the potential energy:\n1 potential at point P = 1j 1 - d V = volume of sphere sphere q D A small volume d V at the distance q contributes d V/y to the potential (Section 8.6, with density 1). The integral adds the contributions from the whole sphere. Equation\n(2) says that the potential at r = D is not changed when the sphere is squeezed to the center. The potential equals the whole volume divided by the single distance D.\nImportant point: The average of l/q is 1/D and not l/q. The average of i and is not 3. Smaller point: I wrote \"sphere\" where I should have written \"ball.\" The sphere is solid: 0 < p < R, 0 <q5 < n,0 < 8 < 2n.\nWhat about the force? For the small volume it is proportional to d v/q2 (this is the inverse square law). But force is a vector, pulling the outside point toward dV-not toward the center of the sphere. The figure shows the geometry and the symmetry.\nWe want the z component of the force. (By symmetry the overall x and y components are zero.) The angle between the force vector and the z axis is a, so for the z component we multiply by cos a. The total force comes from the integral that Newton discovered:\ncos x force at point P = jjj -dV= volume of sphere\n(3) sphere q2 D 2 1 will compute the integral (2) and leave you the privilege of solving (3). 1 mean that word seriously.

Distances q and Q to surface.\none time only Isaac Newton could do. Problem 26 offers a suggestion (just the law of cosines) but the integral is yours.\nThe law of cosines also helps with (2). For the triangle in the figure it gives q2 = D2 - 2pD cos 4 + p2. Call this whole quantity u. We do the surface integral first\n(d) and dB with p fixed). Then q2 = u and q = & and du = 2pD sin 4 d):\n271 came from the 0 integral. The integral of du/& is 2&.\nSince cos 4 = - 1 at the upper limit, u is D2 + 2pD + P2. The square root of u is D + p. At the lower limit cos )= + 1 and u = D2 - 2pD + p2. This is another perfect square-its square root is D - p. The surface integral (4) with fixed p is\n=4aR3/D. This proves formula (2):\nLast comes the p integral:\n4np2dp/~ potential equals volume of the sphere divided by D.\nNote 1 Physicists are also happy about equation (5). The average of l/q is 1/D not only over the solid sphere but over each spherical shell of area 4ap2. The shells can have different densities, as they do in the Earth, and still Newton is correct. This also applies to the force integral (3)-each separate shell acts as if its mass were concentrated at the center. Then the final p integral yields this property for the solid sphere.\nNote 2 Physicists also know that force is minus the derivative of potential. The derivative of (2) with respect to D produces the force integral (3). Problem 27 explains this shortcut to equation (3).\nEXAMPLE 8 Everywhere inside a hollow sphere the force of gravity is zero.\nWhen D is smaller than p, the lower limit & in the integral (4) changes from D - p to p - D. That way the square root stays positive. This changes the answer in (5) to 4np2/p, so the potential no longer depends on D. The potential is constant inside the hollow shell. Since the force comes from its derivative, the force is zero.\nA more intuitive proof is in the second figure.

Therefore the two areas exert equal and opposite forces on the inside point, and they cancel each other. The total force from the shell is zero.\nI believe this zero integral is the reason that the inside of a car is safe from lightning.\nOf course a car is not a sphere. But electric charge distributes itself to keep the surface at constant potential. The potential stays constant inside-therefore no force. The tires help to prevent conduction of current (and electrocution of driver).\nP.S. Don't just step out of the car. Let a metal chain conduct the charge to the ground. Otherwise you could be the conductor.\nCHANGE OF COORDINATES-STRETCHING FACTOR J Once more we look to calculus for a formula. We need the volume of a small curved box in any uvw coordinate system. The r8z box and the p4B box have right angles, and their volumes were read off from the geometry (stretching factors J = r and J = p2 sin 4 in Figures 14.15 and 14.17). Now we change from xyz to other coordinates uvw-which are chosen to fit the problem.\nGoing from xy to uv, the area dA = J du dv was a 2 by 2 determinant. In three dimensions the determinant is 3 by 3. The matrix is always the \"Jacobian matrix,\" containing first derivatives. There were four derivatives from xy to uv, now there are nine from xyz to uuw.\nI4C Suppose x, y, z are given in terms of u, v, w. Then a small faax in uuw space (sides du, dv, dw) comes from a volume d V = J dtc dv dw in xyz space:\nI The volume integral Ijldx dy dz becomes fljIJI du dv dw, with limits on uvw.\nRemember that a 3 by 3 determinant is the sum of six terms (Section 11 3 . One term in J is (ax/du)(dy/dv)(dz/i3w), along the main diagonal. This comes from pure stretching, and the other five terms allow for rotation. The best way to exhibit the formula is for spherical coordinates-where the nine derivatives are easy but the determinant is not:\nEXAMPLE 9 Find the factor J for x = p sin 4 cos 8, y = p sin 4 sin 8, z = p cos 4.\nsin 4 cos 8 p cos 4 cos 8 - p sin 4 sin 8 J = a(x' \"') = sin 4 sin 8 p cos 4 sin 8 p sin 4 cos 8 .\n(6, 8) The determinant has six terms, but two are zero-because of the zero in the corner.\nThe other four terms are p2sin 4 cos24 sin28 and p2sin 4 cos24 cos28 and p2sin34 sin28 and p2sin34 cos28.

We went from dx to jj dx dy and JIJdx dy dz. All those integrals add up small pieces, and the limit gives area or volume or mass. What could be more natural than that? I regret to say, after the success of those multiple integrals, that something is missing. It is even more regrettable that we didn't notice it. The missing piece is nothing less than the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nThe double integral 11dx dy equals the area. To compute it, we did not use an antiderivative of 1. At least not consciously. The method was almost trial and error, and the hard part was to find the limits of integration. This chapter goes deeper, to show how the step from a double integral to a single integral is really a new form of the Fundamental Theorem-when it is done right.\nTwo new ideas are needed early, one pleasant and one not. You will like vector fields. You may not think so highly of line integrals. Those are ordinary single integrals like J v(x)dx, but they go along curves instead of straight lines. The nice step dx becomes the confusing step ds. Where Jdx equals the length of the interval, J ds is the length of the curve. The point is that regions are enclosed by curves, and we have to integrate along them. The Fundamental Theorem in its two-dimensional form\n(Green's Theorem) connects a double integral over the region to a single integral along its boundary curve.\nThe great applications are in science and engineering, where vector fields are so natural.

But among the spin fields, the only gradient is S/r2.\nA ma-jor goal of this chapter is to recognize gradient fields by a simple test. The rejection of S and S/r will be interesting. For some reason -yi + xj is rejected and yi + xj is accepted. (It is the gradient of\n.) The acceptance of S/r2 as the gradient off = 0 contains a surprise at the origin (Section 15.3).\nGradient fields are called conservative.

This assumes that vectors to the center of the Earth are parallel-almost true in a classroom. Then F is the gradient of -mgz (note dfldz = -mg).\nIn physics the usual potential is not -mgz but +mgz. The force field is minus grad f also in electrical engineering. Electrons flow from high potential to low potential.\nThe mathematics is the same, but the sign is reversed.\nIn space, the force is radial inwards: F = - mMGR/r3. Its magnitude is proportional to l/r2 (Newton's inverse square law). The masses are m and M, and the gravitational constant is G =6.672 x 10-\"--with distance in meters, mass in kilograms, and time in seconds. The dimensions of G are (force)(di~tance)~/(mass)~.\nThis is different from the acceleration g =9.8m/sec2, which already accounts for the mass and radius of the Earth.\nLike all radial fields, gravity is a gradient field. It comes from a potential f:\nEXAMPLE 7 (a short example) Current in a wire produces a magnetic field B. It is the spin field S/r2 around the wire, times the strength of the current.\nSTREAMLINES AND LINES OF FORCE Drawing a vector field is not always easy. Even the spin field looks messy when the vectors are too long (they go in circles and fall across each other). The circles give a clearer picture than the vectors. In any field, the vectors are tangent to \"jield lineswwhich in the spin case are circles.\nDEFINITION C is afield line or integral curve if the vectors F(x, y) are tangent to C.\nThe slope dyldx of the curve C equals the slope N/M of the vector F =Mi +Nj:\nWe are still drawing the field of vectors, but now they are infinitesimally short.\nThey are connected into curves!

It can equal an area, but that is a special case and not typical. Instead of area, here are two important line integrals in physics and engineering:\nWork along a curve = F T ds Flow across a curve = In the first integral, F is a force field. In the second integral, F is a flow field. Work is done in the direction of movement, so we integrate F T. Flow is measured through the curve C, so we integrate F n. Here T is the unit tangent vector, and F T is the force cornponent along the curve. Similarly n is the unit normal vector, at right angles with T. Then F n is the component of flow perpendicular to the curve.\nWe will write those integrals in several forms. They may never be as comfortable as J y(x) dx, but eventually we get them under control. I mention these applications early, so you can see where we are going. This section concentrates on work, and flow comes later. (It is also calledflux-the Latin word for flow.) You recognize ds as the step along the curve, corresponding to dx on the x axis. Where f dx gives the length of an interval (it equals b - a), 5 ds is the length of the curve.\nEXAMPLE 1 Flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles on a straight line and a semicircle.\nAccording to Delta Airlines, the distance straight west is 2000 miles. Atlanta is at\n(1000,O) and Los Angeles is at (-1000, O), with the origin halfway between. The semicircle route C has radius 1000. This is not a great circle route. It is more of a\n\"flat circle,\" which goes north past Chicago. No plane could fly it (it probably goes into space).\nThe equation for the semicircle is x2 + y2 = 10002. Parametrically this path is x = 1000 cos t, y = 1000 sin t. For a line integral the parameter is better. The plane leaves Atlanta at t = 0 and reaches L.A. at t = n, more than three hours later. On the straight 2000-mile path, Delta could almost do it. Around the semicircle C, the distance is lOOOn miles and the speed has to be 1000 miles per hour. Remember that speed is distance ds divided by time dt:\ndsldt = ,/(dx~dt)~ + (dyldt)' = l000,/(- sin t)2 + (cos t)2 = 1000.\n(1) The tangent vector to C is proportional to (dxldt, dyldt) = (-1000 sin t, 1000 cos t).\nBut T is a unit vector, so we divide by 1000-which is the speed.\nSuppose the wind blows due east with force F = Mi.

Without a potential we cannot substitute P and Q-and the work depends on the path.\nTHE DEFINITION OF LINE INTEGRALS We go back to the start, to define F T ds.

The last point Q is (x,, y,); the first point P is\n(xo, yo). The step Asi is the distance to (xi, yi) from the previous point. As the steps get small (As -, 0) the straight pieces follow the curve. Exactly as in Section 8.2, the special case g = 1 gives the arc length. As long as g(x, y) is piecewise continuous\n(jumps allowed) and the path is piecewise smooth (corners allowed), the limit exists and defines the line integral.\nWhen g is the density of a wire, the line integral is the total mass. When g is F T, the integral is the work. But nobody does the calculation by formula (5). We now introduce a parameter t-which could be the time, or the arc length s, or the distance x along the base.\nThe diflerential ds becomes (ds/dt)dt. Everything changes over to t:\nThe curve starts when t = a, runs through the points (x(t), y(t)), and ends when t = b.\nThe square root in the integral is the speed dsldt. In three dimensions the points on C are (x(t), y(t), z(t)) and (dz/dt)l is in the square root.\nEXAMPLE 3 The points on a coil spring are (x, y, z) = (cos t, sin t, t).

Thus dsldt = fi.\nTo find the mass, integrate the mass per unit length which is g = p = 4:\nThat is a line integral in three-dimensional space. It shows how to introduce t. But it misses the main point of this section, because it contains no vector field F. This section is about work, not just mass.\nDIFFERENT FORMS OF THE WORK INTEGRAL The work integral I F T ds can be written in a better way. The force is F = Mi + Nj.\nA small step along the curve is dx i + dy j. Work is force times distance, but it is only the force component along the path that counts.

We can choose another parameter 2, since (ds/dt)dt and\n(ds/dz)dz both equal ds. Traveling twice as fast on the straight path (x = 1 - 22, y = 22) we finish at t = 4 instead of t = 1.

The total energy, kinetic plus potential, is conserved.\nINDEPENDENCE OF PATH: GRADIENT FIELDS The work of the spin field S depends on the path. Example 4 took three pathsstraight line, quarter-circle, bent line. The work was 1, 42, and 0, different on each path. This happens for more than 99.99% of all vector fields. It does not happen for the most important fields. Mathematics and physics concentrate on very special fields-for which the work depends only on the endpoints. We now explain what happens, when the integral is independent of the path.\nSuppose you integrate from P to Q on one path, and back to P on another path.\nCombined, that is a closed path from P to P (Figure 15.7). But a backward integral is the negative of a forward integral, since dR switches sign. If the integrals from P to Q are equal, the integral around the closed path is zero:\nclosed path 1 back path 2 path 1 path 2 The circle on the first integral indicates a closed path.

The big question is: How to decide which fields are conservative, without trying all paths?

The components satisfy dM/ay = (3Nldx.\nA field with one of these properties has them all. D is the quick test.\nThese statements A-D bring everything together for conservative fields (alias gradient fields). A closed path goes one way to Q and back the other way to P. The work cancels, and statements A and B are equivalent. We now connect them to C. Note:\nTest D says that the \"curl\" of F is zero. That can wait for Green's Theorem in the next section-the full discussion of the curl comes in 15.6.\nFirst, a gradient field F = grad f is conservative. The work is f (Q) - f (P), by the fundamental theorem for line integrals. It depends only on the endpoints and not the path. Therefore statement C leads back to B.\nOur job is in the other direction, to show that conservative fields Mi + Nj are gradients. Assume that the work integral depends only on the endpoints. We must construct a potentialf, so that F is its gradient. In other words, dfldx must be M and dfldy must be N.\nFix the point P. Define f (Q) as the work to reach Q. Then F equals grad& Check the reasoning. At the starting point P, f is zero. At every other point Q, f is the work J M dx + N dy to reach that point.

No additional function of y is necessary. When we integrate with respect to x, the constant of integration (usually C )becomes a function C(y).\nYou will get practice in finding f.

There is no f.\nTest D gives dM/dy = - 1 and dN/dx = + 1.\nTo finish this section, we move from examples to a proof. The potential f(Q) is defined as the work to reach Q. We must show that its partial derivatives are M and N. This seems reasonable from the formula f (Q) = I M dx + N dy, but we have to think it through.\nRemember statement A, that all paths give the same f(Q). Take a path that goes from P to the left of Q. It comes in to Q on a line y = constant (so dy = 0). As the path reaches Q, we are only integrating M dx. The derivative of this integral, at Q, is df/ax = M. That is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\nTo show that af/ay= N, take a different path. Go from P to a point below Q. The path comes up to Q on a vertical line (so dx = 0). Near Q we are only integrating N dy, so i?f/dy= N.\nThe requirement that the region must have no holes will be critical for test D.\nEXAMPLE 7 Find f (x, y) = x dx + y dy.

That sounds important and it is. The formula was discovered 150 years after Newton and Leibniz, by an ordinary mortal named George Green. His theorem connects a double integral over a region R to a line integral along its boundary C.\nThe integral of dfldx equals f(b) - f (a). This connects a one-dimensional integral to a zero-dimensional integral. The boundary only contains two points a and b! The answer f (b) - f (a) is some kind of a \"point integral.\" It is this absolutely crucial ideato integrate a derivative from information at the boundary-that Green's Theorem extends into two dimensions.\nThere are two important integrals around C. The work is I F T ds = I M dx + N dy.\nThe flux is 1 F n ds = M dy - N dx (notice the switch). The first is for a force field, the second is for a flow field. The tangent vector T turns 90\" clockwise to become the normal vector n. Green's Theorem handles both, in two dimensions. In three dimensions they split into the Divergence Theorem (1 5.5) and Stokes' Theorem (1 5.6).\nGreen's Theorem applies to \"smooth\" functions M(x, y) and N(x, y), with continuous first derivatives in a region slightly bigger than R. Then all integrals are well defined. M and N will have a definite and specific meaning in each application-to electricity or magnetism or fluid flow or mechanics. The purpose of a theorem is to capture the central ideas once and for all. We do that now, and the applications follow.\n1SE Green's TIreorm Suppose the region R is bounded by the simple closed piecewise smooth curve C. Thm an integral over R equals a line integral around C:\nA curve is \"simple\" if it doesn't cross itself (figure 8's are excluded). It is \"closed\" if its endpoint Q is the same as its starting point P. This is indicated by the closed circle on the integral sign. The curve is \"smooth\" if its tangent T changes continuouslythe word \"piecewise\" allows a finite number of corners. Fractals are not allowed, but all reasonable curves are acceptable (later we discuss figure 8's and rings).

The proof uses the Fundamental Theorem to integrate (aN/ax)dx and (aM/dy)dy. Frankly speaking, this one-dimensional theorem is all we have to work with-since we don't know M and N.\nThe proof is a step up in mathematics, to work with symbols M and N instead of specific functions.

In (7) it has a plus sign but the integral is from b to a. So life is good.\nThe part for N uses the same idea. Now the x integral comes first, because\n(0N/ax)dx is practically asking to be integrated-from x = G(y) at the left to x = F(y) at the right. We reach N(F(y), y) - N(G(y), y). Then the y integral matches § Ndy and completes (5). Adding the two parts of (5) proves Green's Theorem.\nFinally we discuss the shape of R. The broken ring in Figure 15.10 is not \"very simple,\" because horizontal lines go in and out and in and out. Vertical lines do the same. The x and y strips break into pieces. Our reasoning assumed no break between y =f(x) at the top and y = g(x) at the bottom.\nThere is a nice idea that saves Green's Theorem. Separate the broken ring into three very simple regions R 1, R2, R 3 . The three double integrals equal the three line integrals around the R's. Now add these separate results, to produce the double integral over all of R. When we add the line integrals, the crosscuts CC are covered twice and they cancel. The cut between R1 and R2 is covered upward (around R1) and downward (around R 2). That leaves the integral around the boundary equal to the double integral inside-which is Green's Theorem.\nWhen R is a complete ring, including the piece R4 , the theorem is still true. The integral around the outside is still counterclockwise. But the integral is clockwise around the inner circle. Keep the region R to your left as you go around C. The complete ring is \"doubly\" connected, not \"simply\" connected. Green's Theorem allows any finite number of regions Ri and crosscuts CC and holes.\nEXAMPLE 3 The area under a curve is jb y dx, as we always believed.\nIn computing area we never noticed the whole boundary. The true area is a line integral - y dx around the closed curve in Figure 15.11 a. But y = 0 on the x axis.\nAlso dx = 0 on the vertical lines (up and down at b and a). Those parts contribute zero to the integral of y dx. The only nonzero part is back along the curve-which is the area - a y dx or I' y dx that we know well.\nWhat about signs, when the curve dips below the x axis? That area has been counted as negative since Chapter 1. I saved the proof for Chapter 15. The reason lies in the arrows on C.\nThe line integral around that part goes the other way. The arrows are clockwise, the region is on the right, and the area counts as negative. With the correct rules, a figure 8 is allowed after all.\n566\n•(x) J Mdx r y = g", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 586, "section_id": "s0017-15pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Nonconservative field because of hole.\nCONSERVATIVE FIELDS We never leave gradients alone! They give conservative fields-the work around a closed path is f(P) -f(P) = 0. But a potential function f(x, y) is only available when test D is passed: If Of/ax = M and af/Oy = N then dM/ly = aN/ax. The reason is that fxy =fx .\nSome applications prefer the language of \"differentials.\" Instead of looking for f(x, y), we look for df:\nDEFINITION The expression M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy is a differential form. When it agrees with the differential df= (df/Ox)dx + (f/aOy) dy of some function, the form is called exact. The test for an exact differential is D: ON/Ox = OM/ay.\nNothing is new but the language. Is y dx an exact differential? No, because My = 1 and Nx = 0. Is y dx + x dy an exact differential? Yes, it is the differential of f= xy.\nThat is the product rule! Now comes an important example, to show why R should be simply connected (a region with no holes).\nEXAMPLE 4 The spin field S/r 2 = (- yi + xj)/(x 2 + y 2) almost passes test D.\n( x x2 y 2-x(2x) M a(-y\n(X2 + y 2)+y(2y) N=\n-M-(8) X•\n-~x~2\n(X + y 2)2\n(X2 y 2)2 Both numerators are y2x2. Test D looks good. To find f, integrate M = Of/ax:\nf(x, y) =\n- y dx/(x2 + y2) = tan- (yx) + C(y).\nThe extra part C(y) can be zero--the y derivative of tan- '(y/x) gives N with no help from C(y). The potentialf is the angle 0 in the usual x, y, r right triangle.\nTest D is passed and F is grad 0. What am I worried about? It is only this, that Green's Theorem on a circle seems to give 27r = 0. The double integral is ff (Nx - My)dx dy. According to (8) this is the integral of zero. But the line integral is 27r:\nF* dR = (- y dx + x dy)/(x 2 + y2)= 2(area of circle)/a 2 = 2ra2/a2 = 27.\n(9) With x = a cos t and y = a sin t we would find the same answer. The work is 27r (not zero!) when the path goes around the origin.\nWe have a paradox. If Green's Theorem is wrong, calculus is in deep trouble. Some requirement must be violated to reach 27t = 0. Looking at S/r 2, the problem is at the origin. The field is not defined when r = 0 (it blows up). The derivatives in (8) are not continuous. Test D does not apply at the origin, and was not passed. We could remove\n(0, 0), but then the region where test D is passed would have a hole.\n567 u I-V", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 587, "section_id": "s0017-15pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

The 27r is right, the zero is wrong. Nx - My must be a \"delta function of strength 2n.\" The double integral is 27r from an infinite spike over the origin-even though N, = My everywhere else. In fluid flow the delta function is a ''vortex.\" FLOW ACROSS A CURVE: GREEN'S THEOREM TURNED BY 90\" A flow field is easier to visualize than a force field, because something is really there and it moves. Instead of gravity in empty space, water has velocity M(x, y)i + N(x, y)j.\nAt the boundary C it can flow in or out. The new form of Green's Theorem is a fundamental \"balance equation\" of applied mathematics:\nFlow through C (out minus in) = replacement in R (source minus sink).\nThe flow is steady. Whatever goes out through C must be replaced in R. When there are no sources or sinks (negative sources), the total flow through C must be zero.\nThis balance law is Green's Theorem in its \"normal form\" (for n) instead of its\n\"tangential form\" (for T):\nC 15F For a steady flow field F = M(x, y)i + N(x, y)j, the flux 1 F n ds through the boundary C balances the replacement of fluid inside R:\nFigure 15.12 shows the 90\" turn. T becomes n and \"circulation\" along C becomes flux through C. In the original form of Green's Theorem, change N and M to M and\n- N to obtain the flux form:\nPlaying with letters has proved a new theorem! The two left sides in (1 1) are equal, so the right sides are equal-which is Green's Theorem (10) for the flux. The components M and N can be chosen freely and named freely.\nThe change takes Mi + Nj into its perpendicular field - Ni + Mj. The field is turned at every point (we are not just turning the plane by 90\"). The spin field S = - yi + xj changes to the position field R = xi + yj. The position field R changes to -S.

It is easier to visualize flow across a curve than circulation along it.\nThe change of letters was just for the proof. From now on F = Mi + Nj.\nEXAMPLE 5 Compute both sides of the new form (10) for F = 2xi + 3yj. The region R is a rectangle with sides a and b.\nSolution This field has dM/ax + ON/ly = 2 + 3. The integral over R is f, 5 dx dy = 5ab. The line integral has four parts, because R has four sides. Between the left and right sides, M = 2x increases by 2a. Down the left and up the right, fM dy = 2ab\n(those sides have length b). Similarly N = 3y changes by 3b between the bottom and top. Those sides have length a, so they contribute 3ab to a total line integral of 5ab.\nImportant: The \"divergence\" of a flow field is aM/ax + aNlay. The example has divergence = 5. To maintain this flow we must replace 5 units continually-not just at the origin but everywhere. (A one-point source is in example 7.) The divergence is the source strength, because it equals the outflow. To understand Green's Theorem for any vector field Mi + Nj, look at a tiny rectangle (sides dx and dy):\nFlow out the right side minus flow in the left side = (change in M) times dy Flow out the top minus flow in the bottom = (change in N) times dx Total flow out of rectangle: dM dy + dN dx = (aM/ax + aN/ay)dx dy.\nThe divergence times the area dx dy equals the total flow out.

The spin field has no flux.\nEXAMPLE 6 Find the flux through a closed curve C of the spin field S = - yi + xj.\nSolution The field has M = - y and N = x and Mx + N, = 0. The double integral is zero. Therefore the total flow (out minus in) is also zero-through any closed curve.\nFigure 15.13 shows flow entering and leaving a square. No fluid is added or removed.\nThere is no rain and no evaporation. When the divergence Mx + N, is zero, there is no source or sink.\nFLOW FIELDS WITHOUT SOURCES This is really quite important. Remember that conservative fields do no work around C, they have a potential f, and they have \"zero curl.\" Now turn those statements through 90', to find their twins.

Now the region moves out of the plane. It becomes a curved surface S, part of a sphere or cylinder or cone. When the surface has only one z for each (x, y), it is the graph of a function z(x, y). In other cases S can twist and close up-a sphere has an upper z and a lower z. In all cases we want to compute area and flux. This is a necessary step (it is our last step) before moving Green's Theorem to three dimensions.\nFirst a quick review. The basic integrals are 1 dx and 11 dx dy and 111 dx dy dz. The one that didn't fit was Jds-the length of a curve. When we go from curves to surfaces, ds becomes dS. Area is JI dS m d flux is IJ F n dS, with double integrals because the surfaces are two-dimensional. The main difficulty is in dS.\nAll formulas are summarized in a table at the end of the section.\nThere are two ways to deal with ds (along curves). The same methods apply to dS\n(on surfaces). The first is in xyz coordinates; the second uses parameters. Before this subject gets complicated, I will explain those two methods.\nMethod 1 is for the graph of a function: curve y(x) or surface z(x, y).\nA small piece of the curve is almost straight. It goes across by dx and up by dy:\nlength ds = J= ,/i+(dyldx)2 dx.\n(1) A small piece of the surface is practically flat. Think of a tiny sloping rectangle. One side goes across by dx and up by (dz/dx)dx. The neighboring side goes along by dy and up by (az/dy)dy. Computing the area is a linear problem (from Chapter 1 I), because the flat piece is in a plane.\nTwo vectors A and B form a parallelogram. The length of their cross product is the area. In the present case, the vectors are A = i + (az/ax)k and B = j + (az/ay)k. Then Adx and Bdy are the sides of the small piece, and we compute A x B:\nThis is exactly the normal vector N to the tangent plane and the surface, from Chapter 13.

Its area dS is much like ds, but the length of N = A x B involves two derivatives:\narea dS = IAdx x Bdyl = INIdx dy = 1 + (az/ax)2 + (z/aOy) 2 dx dy.\n(3) EXAMPLE 1 Find the area on the plane z = x + 2y above a base area A.\nThis is the example to visualize. The area down in the xy plane is A. The area up on the sloping plane is greater than A. A roof has more area than the room underneath it. If the roof goes up at a 450 angle, the ratio is 2/. Formula (3) yields the correct ratio for any surface--including our plane z = x + 2y.\nX = U Cos y = u sin v u X = Cos V y = sin v Z=U Y Fig. 15.14 Roof area = base area times |NI. Cone and cylinder with parameters u and v.\nThe derivatives are dz/dx = 1 and az/ay = 2. They are constant (planes are easy).\nThe square root in (3) contains 1 + 12 + 22 = 6. Therefore dS = 6 dx dy. An area in the xy plane is multiplied by 6 up in the surface (Figure 15.14a). The vectors A and B are no longer needed-their work was done when we reached formula (3)-but here they are:\nA=i+(az/ax)k=i+k B=j+(az/ay)k=j+2k N= -i-2j+k.\nThe length of N = A x B is 6. The angle between k and N has cos 0 = 1/ 6. That is the angle between base plane and sloping plane. Therefore the sloping area is 6 times the base area. For curved surfaces the idea is the same, except that the square root in INI = 1/cos 0 changes as we move around the surface.\nMethod 2 is for curves x(t), y(t) and surfaces x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) with parameters.\nA curve has one parameter t. A surface has two parameters u and v (it is twodimensional). One advantage of parameters is that x, y, z get equal treatment, instead of picking out z as f(x, y). Here are the first two examples:\ncone x = u cos v, y = u sin v, z = u cylinder x = cos v, y = sin v, z = u.\n(4) Each choice of u and v gives a point on the surface. By making all choices, we get the complete surface. Notice that a parameter can equal a coordinate, as in z = u.\nSometimes both parameters are coordinates, as in x = u and y = v and z =f(u, v).\nThat is just z =f(x, y) in disguise-the surface without parameters. In other cases we find the xyz equation by eliminating u and v:\ncone\n(u cos v)2 +(uin )2= 2 or X2y 2=z Or z==x 2 y 2 cylinder (cos v)2 + (sin v)2 = 1 or x2 +y 2 = 1.\nI I", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 594, "section_id": "s0017-15pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

Parameters allow a surface to close up and even go through itself-which the graph of f(x, y) can never do.\nActually z = Jw gives only the top half of the cone. (A function produces only one z.) The parametric form gives the bottom half also. Similarly y = ,/- gives only the top of a circle, while x = cos t, y = sin t goes all the way around.\nNow we find dS, using parameters.

In these and many other examples, A is perpendicular to B. The small piece is a rectangle. Its sides have length IAl du and IB(dv. (The cone has ]A/ = u and IBI = &, the cylinder has IAl= IBI = 1). The cross product is hardly needed for area, when we can just multiply IAl du times IBldv.\nRemark on the two methods Method 1 also used parameters, but a very special choice--u is x and v is y. The parametric equations are x = x, y = y, z = f(x, y). If you go through the long square root in (7), changing u to x and v to y, it simplifies to the s'quare root in (3). (The terms dy/dx and axlay are zero; axldx and dyldy are 1.) Still it pays to remember the shorter formula from Method 1.\nDon't forget that after computing dS, you have to integrate it. Many times the good is with polar coordinates. Surfaces are often symmetric around an axis or a point. Those are the surfaces of revolution-which we saw in Chapter 8 and will come back to.\nStrictly speaking, the integral starts with AS (not dS). A flat piece has area\n[A x BlAxAy or [A x BlAuAv.

A horizontal surface has dS = 1 dx dy, as we have known all year.\nNow for a key point. The integration is down in the base plane. The limits on x and y are given by the \"shadow\" of the cone.

It might not occur to a reasonable person, but sometimes a surface has only one side. The famous example is the Miibius strip, for which you take a strip of paper, twist it once, and tape the ends together. Its special property appears when you run a pen along the \"inside.\" The pen in Figure 15.20 suddenly goes \"outside.\" After another round trip it goes back \"inside.\" Those words are in quotation marks, because on a Mdbius strip they have no meaning.\nSuppose the pen represents the normal vector. On a sphere n points outward.\nAlternatively n could point inward; we are free to choose. But the M6bius strip makes the choice impossible. After moving the pen continuously, it comes back in the opposite direction. This surface is not orientable. We cannot integrate F * n to compute the flux, because we cannot decide the direction of n.\nA surface is oriented when we can and do choose n. This uses the final property of cross products, that they have length and direction and also a right-hand rule. We can tell A x B from B x A. Those give the two orientations of n. For an open surface\n(like a wastebasket) you can select either one. For a closed surface (like a sphere) it is conventional for n to be outward. By making that decision once and for all, the sign of the flux is established: outward flux is positive.\nFORMULAS FOR SURFACE INTEGRALS 15.4 EXERCISES Read-through questions A small piece of the surface z =f(x, y) is nearly a .When we go across by dx, we go up by b .

' T L ~ Mrlgcaee Threni h I In Green's Theorem the divergence was dM/dx + dN/dy. The new term dP/dz accounts for upward flow. Notice that a constant upward component P adds nothing to the divergence (its derivative is zero). It also adds nothing to the flux (flow up through the top equals flow up through the bottom). When the whole field F is constant, the theorem becomes 0 = 0.\nThere are other vector fields with div F = 0. They are of the greatest importance.\nThe Divergence Theorem for those fields is again 0 = 0, and there is conservation of fluid. When div F = 0, flow in equals flow out. We begin with examples of these\n\"divergence-free\" fields.\nEXAMPLE 1 The spin fields - yi + xj + Ok and Oi - zj + yk have zero divergence.\nThe first is an old friend, spinning around the z axis. The second is new, spinning around the x axis. Three-dimensional flow has a great variety of spin fields. The separate terms dM/dx, dN/dy, dP/az are all zero, so div F = 0. The flow goes around in circles, and whatever goes out through S comes back in. (We might have put a circle on 11, as we did on $c, to emphasize that S is closed.) EXAMPLE 2 The position field R = xi + yj + zk has div R = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\nThis is radial flow, straight out from the origin. Mass has to be added at every point to keep the flow going. On the right side of the divergence theorem is [[[ 3 dl/.\nTherefore the flux is three times the volume.\nExample 11 in Section 15.4 found the flux of R through a cylinder. The answer was 3nb. Now we also get 3nb from the Divergence Theorem, since the volume is nb.\nThis is one of many cases in which the triple integral is easier than the double integral.\nEXAMPLE 3 An electrostatic field R/p3 or gravity field - R/p3 almost has div F = 0.\nThe vector R = xi + yj + zk has length\n= p. Then F has length p/p3\n(inverse square law). Gravity from a point mass pulls inward (minus sign). The electric field from a point charge repels outward. The three steps almost show that div F = 0:\nStep 1. ap/ax = x/p, dplay = y/p, apldz = z/p-but do not add those three. F is not p or l/p2 (these are scalars). The vector field is We need dM/ax, aN/ay, aP/dz.\nStep 2. a ~ / a x\n= d/dx(x/p3) is equal to l/p3 - ( 3 ~ dp/ax)/p4 = 1lp3 - 3x2/p5. For dN/dy and dP/az, replace 3x2 by 3y2 and 3z2. Now add those three.\nStep 3. div F = 3lp3 - 3(x2 + y2 + z2)/p5 = 3lp3 - 3lp3 = 0.\nThe calculation div F = 0 leaves a puzzle. One side of the Divergence Theorem seems to give jjjO dV= 0. Then the other side should be jJ F * ndS = 0. But the flux is not zero when all flow is outward:\nThe unit normal vector to the sphere p = constant is n = Rip.\nThe outward flow F n = ( ~ 1 ~ ~ )\n(Rip) = p2/p4 is always positive.\nThen jj F ndS = jj ds/p2 = 4np2/p2 = 4n.

The divergence is a \"delta function\" times 47r, from the point source. The Divergence Theorem does not apply\n(unless we allow delta functions). That single point makes all the difference.\nEvery surface enclosing the origin has flux = 47r. Our calculation was for a sphere.\nThe surface integral is much harder when S is twisted (Figure 15.21 a). But the Divergence Theorem takes care of everything, because div F = 0 in the volume V between these surfaces. Therefore Jf F ndS = 0 for the two surfaces together.

A charge q at the origin produces an electric field E = (q/4rneo)R/p 3\n. The physical constants are G and go, the mathematical constant is the relation between divergence and flux. Equation (1) yields equation (2), in which the mass densities M(x, y, z) and charge densities q(x, y, z) need not be concentrated at the origin:\n45L Gauss's law in differential form: div F= - 4GM and div E = q/eo Gauss's law in integral form: Flux is proportional to total mass or charge:\n{{F ndS= - {J'j47rGMdV and JJE ndS = qdV/lo.\n(2) THE REASONING BEHIND THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM The general principle is clear: Flow out minus flow in equals source. Our goal is to see why the divergence of F measures the source. In a small box around each point, we show that div F dV balances F * ndS through the six sides.\nSo consider a small box. Its center is at (x, y, z). Its edges have length Ax, Ay, Az.\nOut of the top and bottom, the normal vectors are k and -k. The dot product with F = Mi + Nj + Pk is + P or -P. The area AS is AxAy. So the two fluxes are close to P(x, y, z + ½Az)AxAy and - P(x, y, z - ½Az)AxAy. When the top is combined with the bottom, the difference of those P's is AP:\nnet flux upward ,- APAxAy = (AP/Az)AxAyAz , (OP/Oz)A V.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 604, "section_id": "s0017-15pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

For F = xi + yj + zk, a little more goes out than comes in. The divergence is 3, so 3AV is created inside the box. By the balance equation the flux is also 3AK The approximation symbol x means that the leading term is correct (probably not the next term). The ratio APlAz is not exactly dP/az. The difference is of order Az, so the error in (3) is of higher order AVAz. Added over many boxes (about 1/AV boxes), this error disappears as Az + 0.\nThe sum of (div F)A V over all the boxes approaches [Sj(div F)dK On the other side of the equation is a sum of fluxes. There is F *nAS out of the top of one box, plus F nAS out of the bottom of the box above. The first has n = k and the second has n = - k. They cancel each other-the flow goes from box to box. This happens every time two boxes meet. The only fluxes that survive (because nothing cancels them) are at the outer surface S. The final step, as Ax, Ay, Az + 0, is that those outside terms approach 11 F ndS. Then the local divergence theorem (4) becomes the global Divergence Theorem (1).\nRemark on the proof That \"final step\" is not easy, because the box surfaces don't line up with the outer surface S. A formal proof of the Divergence Theorem would imitate the proof of Green's Theorem. On a very simple region JjJ (aP/az)dx dy dz equals 11 P dx dy over the top minus 11 P dx dy over the bottom. After checking the orientation this is 11 Pk ndS. Similarly the volume integrals of dM/ax and dN/dy are the surface integrals 11 Mi ndS and 11 Nj ndS. Adding the three integrals gives the Divergence Theorem. Since Green's Theorem was already proved in this way, the reasoning behind (4) is more helpful than repeating a detailed proof.\nThe discoverer of the Divergence Theorem was probably Gauss. His notebooks only contain the outline of a proof-but after all, this is Gauss. Green and Ostrogradsky both published proofs in 1828, one in England and the other in St. Petersburg\n(now Leningrad). As the theorem was studied, the requirements came to light (smoothness of F and S, avoidance of one-sided Mobius strips).\nNew applications are discovered all the time-when a scientist writes down a balance equation in a small box. The source is known. The equation is div F = source.\nAfter Example 5 we explain F.\nEXAMPLE 4 If the temperature inside the sun is T = In lip, find the heat flow F =\n- grad T and the source div F and the flux 11 F . ndS. The sun is a ball of radius po.\nSolution F is -grad In l/p = +grad In p.

Calculus teaches the right things.\nThis framework is developed in many books, including my own text Introduction to Applied Mathematics (Wellesley-Cambridge Press). It governs equilibrium, in matrix equations and differential equations.\nPRODUCT RULE FOR VECTORS: INTEGRATION BY PARTS May I go back to basic facts about the divergence? First the definition:\nF(X, y, Z) = Mi + Nj + ~k has div F = v F = a ~ l a x\n+ a ~ l a y + aplaz.\nThe divergence is a scalar (not a vector). At each point div F is a number. In fluid flow, it is the rate at which mass leaves-the\n\"flux per unit volume\" or \"flux density.\" The symbol V stands for a vector whose components are operations not numbers:\nv = \"del\" = i alax + j alay + k alaz.\n(6) This vector is illegal but very useful. First, apply it to an ordinary function f(x, y, z):\nVf =\"del f\" = i aflax+j af/dy+ k df/az=gradient off.\n(7) Second, take the dot product V F with a vector function F(x, y, z) = Mi + Nj + Pk:\nV F = \"del dot F\" = aM/dx + aN/dy + aP/az = divergence of F.\n(8) Third, take the cross product V x F. This produces the vector curl F (next section):\nV x F = \"del cross F\" = . . . (to be defined). . . = curl of F.\n(9) The gradient and divergence and curl are V and V and V x . The three great operations of vector calculus use a single notation! You are free to write V or not-to make equations shorter or to help the memory. Notice that Laplace's equation shrinks to Equation (10) gives the potential when the source is zero (very common). F = grad f combines with div F = 0 into Laplace's equation div grad f = 0. This equation is so important that it shrinks further to V2 f = 0 and even to A f = 0. Of course A f = fxx + fyy + f,, has nothing to do with A f = f (x + Ax) - f (x).

So far we have emphasized the Fundamental Theorem. The integral of df/dx is now the integral of div F. Instead of endpoints a and b, we have a curve C or surface S.

Remember the derivative of u times v and the integral (by parts) of u dvldx:\n15M Scalar functions u(x, y, z) and vector fields V (x, y, z) obey the product rule:\ndiv(uV) = u div V + V (grad zr).\n(1 1) The reverse of the product rule is integration by parts (Gauss's Formula):\nFor a plane field this is Green's Fwmurla (and u = 1 gives Green's Theorem):\nThose look like heavy formulas. They are too much to memorize, unless you use them often. The important point is to connect vector calculus with \"scalar calculus,\" which is not heavy. Every product rule yields two terms:\nAdd those ordinary rules and you have the vector rule (1 1) for the divergence of uV.\nIntegrating the two parts of div(uV) gives I[ uV ndS by the Divergence Theorem.\nThen one part moves to the other side, producing the minus signs in (12) and (13).\nIntegration by parts leaves a boundary term, in three and two dimensions as it did in one dimension: uvtdx = - j utvdx + [uv]:.\nEXAMPLE 5 Find the divergence of F = R/p2, starting from grad p = R/p.\nSolution Take V = R and u = llp2 in the product rule (1 1).

Air has a greater velocity than water, but a much lower density. So normally F = pV is larger for the ocean. (Don't confuse the density p with the radial distance p. The Greeks only used 24 letters.) There is another difference between water and air. Water is virtually incompressible\n(meaning p = constant). Air is certainly compressible (its density varies).

The turning speed is ), because this curl has magnitude 1.\nAnother velocity field v = - xk produces the same spin: curl v = j. The flow is in the z direction, it varies in the x direction, and the spin is in the y direction. Also interesting is V + v. The two \"shear fields\" add to a perfect spin field S = zi - xk, whose curl is 2j.\nTHE MEANING OF CURL F Example 5 put a paddlewheel into the flow. This is possible for any vector field F, and it gives insight into curl F. The turning of the wheel (if it turns) depends on its location (x, y, z). The turning also depends on the orientation of the wheel. We could put it into a spin field, and if the wheel axis n is perpendicular to the spin axis a, the wheel won't turn! The general rule for turning speed is this: the angular velocity of the wheel is %curl F) n. This is the bbdirectional spin,\" just as (grad f ) o was the\n\"directional derivative\"-and n is a unit vector like u.\nThere is no spin anywhere in a gradient field. It is irrotational: curl grad f = 0.\nThe pure spin field a x R has curl F = 2a. The angular velocity is a n (note that\n) cancels 2). This turning is everywhere, not just at the origin. If you put a penny on a compact disk, it turns once when the disk rotates once. That spin is \"around itself,\" and it is the same whether the penny is at the center or not.\nThe turning speed is greatest when the wheel axis n lines up with the spin axis a.\nThen a n is the full length (a(. The gradient gives the direction of fastest growth, and the curl gives the direction of fastest turning:\nmaximum growth rate off is lgrad f 1 in the direction of grad f maximum rotation rate of F is f lcurl FI in the direction of curl F.", "source": {"file": "Calculus.pdf", "page": 611, "section_id": "s0017-15pdf"}, "tags": ["calculus"]}

It will be like Green's Theorem-a line integral equals a surface integral. The line integral is still the work f F* dR around a curve.\nThe surface integral in Green's Theorem is ff (Nx - M,) dx dy. The surface is flat (in the xy plane). Its normal direction is k, and we now recognize Nx - My as the k component of the curl. Green's Theorem uses only this component because the normal direction is always k. For Stokes' Theorem on a curved surface, we need all three components of curl F.\nFigure 15.24 shows a hat-shaped surface S and its boundary C (a closed curve).\nWalking in the positive direction around C, with your head pointing in the direction of n, the surface is on your left. You may be standing straight up (n = k in Green's Theorem). You may even be upside down (n = - k is allowed). In that case you must go the other way around C, to keep the two sides of equation (6) equal. The surface is still on the left. A M6bius strip is not allowed, because its normal direction cannot be established. The unit vector n determines the \"counterclockwise direction\" along C.\n450 (Stokes' Theorem) F* dR =\n(curl F) ndS.\n(6) The right side adds up small spins in the surface. The left side is the total circulation\n(or work) around C. That is not easy to visualize-this may be the hardest theorem in the book-but notice one simple conclusion. If curl F = 0 then f F . dR = 0. This applies above all to gradient fields-as we know.\nA gradient field has no curl, by (4). A gradient field does no work, by (6). In three dimensions as in two dimensions, gradient fields are conservative fields. They will be the focus of this section, after we outline a proof (or two proofs) of Stokes' Theorem.\nThe first proof shows why the theorem is true. The second proof shows that it really is true (and how to compute). You may prefer the first.\nFirst proof Figure 15.24 has a triangle ABC attached to a triangle ACD. Later there can be more triangles. S will be piecewiseflat, close to a curved surface. Two triangles are enough to make the point. In the plane of each triangle (they have different n's) Green's Theorem is known:\n4 F dR= ff curl F ndS\n~ FdR= if curl F ndS.\nAB+BC+CA ABC AC+CD+DA ACD Now add. The right sides give ff curl F .ndS over the two triangles. On the left, the integral over CA cancels the integral over AC. The \"crosscut\" disappears. That leaves AB + BC + CD + DA.

Notice how Green's Theorem (flat surface) was the key to both proofs of Stokes' Theorem (curved surface).\nEXAMPLE 6 Stokes' Theorem in electricity and magnetism yields Faraday's Law.\nStokes' Theorem is not heavily used for calculations-equation\n(8) shows why. But the spin or curl or vorticity of a flow is absolutely basic in fluid mechanics. The other important application, coming now, is to electric fields. Faraday's Law is to Gauss's Law as Stokes' Theorem is to the Divergence Theorem.\nSuppose the curve C is an actual wire. We can produce current along C by varying the magnetic field B(t). The flux q = JJ B ndS, passing within C and changing in time, creates an electric field E that does work:\n/.\nFaraday's Law (integral form): work = E dR = - dqldt.\nI That is physics. It may be true, it may be an approximation. Now comes mathematics\n(surely true), which turns this integral form into a differential equation.

Remember test D for plane curves and plane vector fields:\nif aM/dy = dN/dx then F is conservative and F = grad f and $ F - dR = 0.\nNow allow a three-dimensional field like F = 2xy i + (x2 + z)j + yk. Does it do work around a space curve? Or is it a gradient field? That will require aflax = 2xy and afjdy = x2 + z and af/az = y. We have three equations for one function f(x, y, z).\nNormally they can't be solved. When test D is passed (now it is the three-dimensional test: curl F = 0) they can be solved.

Ifcurl F = 0 then f F dR = 0.\nBut that is not news.

The second step leaves an arbitrary c(z) to fix the third step (not needed here). Assembling the three steps, f = x2y + C = x2y + yz + c = x~~ + yz. Please recognize that the \"fix-up\" is only possible when curl F = 0. Test D must be passed.\nEXAMPLE 7 Is F = (Z - y)i + (x - z)j + (y - x)k the gradient of any f?\nTest D says no. This F is a spin field a x R. Its curl is 2a = (2,2,2), which is not zero.\nA search for f is bound to fail, but we can try. To match df/dx = z - y, we must have f = zx - yx + C(y, z).

The rest of the answer depends on where the courses are going. This chapter can be a useful reference, to give a clearer idea than course titles can do:\nLinear Algebra Differential Equations Discrete Mathematics Advanced Calculus (with Fourier Series) Numerical Methods Statistics Pure mathematics is often divided into analysis and algebra and geometry. Those parts come together in the \"mathematical way of thinking9'-a mixture of logic and ideas. It is a deep and creative subject-here we make a start.\nTwo main courses after calculus are linear algebra and differential equations.\nI hope you can take both. To help you later, Sections 16.1 and 16.2 organize them by examples. First a few words to compare and contrast those two subjects.\nLinear algebra is about systems of equations. There are n variables to solve for. A change in one affects the others. They can be prices or velocities or currents or concentrations-outputs from any model with interconnected parts.\nLinear algebra makes only one assumption-the model must be linear. A change in one variable produces proportional changes in all variables. Practically every subject begins that way. (When it becomes nonlinear, we solve by a sequence of linear equations. Linear programming is nonlinear because we require x >, 0.)Elsewhere J wrote that \"Linear algebra has become as basic and as applicable as calculus, and fortunately it is easier.\" I recommend taking it.\nA differential equation is continuous (from calculus), where a matrix equation is discrete (from algebra). The rate dyldt is determined by the present state y-which changes by following that rule.

Matrices are a part, networks and algorithms are a bigger part. Derivatives are not a part-this is closer to algebra. It is needed in computer science. Some people have a knack for counting the ways a computer can send ten messages in parallel-and for finding the fastest way.\nTypical question: Can 25 states be matched with 25 neighbors, so one state in each pair has an even number of letters? New York can pair with New Jersey, Texas with Oklahoma, California with Arizona. We need rules for Hawaii and Alaska. This matching question doesn't sound mathematical, but it is.\nSection 16.3 selects four topics from discrete mathematics, so you can decide if you want more.\nGo back for a moment to calculus and differential equations. A completely realistic problem is seldom easy, but we can solve models. (Developing a good model is a skill in itself.) One method of solution involves complex numbers:\nany function u(x + iy) solves uxx+ u, = 0 (Laplace equation) any function eik(\"+\") solves u,, - c2uxx= 0 (wave equation).\nFrom those building blocks we assemble solutions. For the wave equation, a signal starts at t = 0.It is a combination of pure oscillations eikx.The coefficients in that combination make up the Fourier transform-to tell how much of each frequency is in the signal. A lot of engineers and scientists would rather know those Fourier coefficients than f(x).\nA Fourier series breaks the signal into Z a, cos kx or Z b, sin kx or T. ekeikx.\nThese sums can be infinite (like power series). Instead of values of f(x), or derivatives at the basepoint, the function is described by a,, b,, c,. Everything is computed by the \"Fast Fourier Transform.\" This is the greatest algorithm since Newton's method.\nA radio signal is near one frequency. A step function has many frequencies. A delta function has every frequency in the same amount: 6(x) = Z cos kx. Channel 4 can't broadcast a perfect step function. You wouldn't want to hear a delta function.\nWe mentioned computing. For nonlinear equations this means Newton's method.\nFor Ax = b it means elimination-algorithms take the place of formulas. Exact solutions are gone-speed and accuracy and stability become essential. It seems right to make scientific computing a part of applied mathematics, and teach the algorithms with the theory. My text Introduction to Applied Mathematics is one step in this direction, trying to present advanced calculus as it is actually used.\nWe cannot discuss applications and forget statistics. Our society produces oceans of data-somebody has to draw conclusions. To decide if a new drug works, and if oil spills are common or rare, and how often to have a checkup, we can't just guess.\nI am astounded that the connection between smoking and health was hidden for centuries. It was in the data! Eventually the statisticians uncovered it. Professionals can find patterns, and the rest of us can understand (with a little mathematics) what has been found.\nOne purpose in studying mathematics is to know more about your own life.\nCalculus lights up a key idea: Functions. Shapes and populations and heart signals and profits and growth rates, all are given by functions. They change in time. They have integrals and derivatives. To understand and use them is a challengemathematics takes effort. A lot of people have contributed, in whatever way they could-as you and I are doing.

An m by n matrix A has m rows and n columns\n(it is square if m =n). It multiplies a vector x that has n components. The result is a vector Ax with m components. The central problem of linear algebra is to go backward: From Ax =bfind x. That is possible when A is square and invertible. Otherwise there is no solution x-or there are infinitely many.\nThe crucial property of matrix multiplication is linearity. If Ax = b and AX = B then A times x + X is b +B. Also A times 2x is 2b. In general A times cx is cb.\nIn particular A times 0 is 0 (one vector has n zeros, the other vector has m zeros). The\n.\nwhole subject develops from linearity. Derivatives and integrals obey linearity too.\nQuestion 1 What are the solutions to Ax =O?\nOne solution is x =0. There may be other solutions and they fill up the \"nullspace\":\nx = 2 x = o 011 requires 1\n=[J also allows y = - 1 y = o z z = 3 L A When there are more unknowns than equations-when A has more columns than rows-the system Ax =0 has many solutions. They are not scattered randomly around! Another solution is X =4, Y= -2, Z =6. This lies on the same line as\n(2, -1,3) and (0,0,O). Always the solutions to Ax =0 form a \"space\" of vectorswhich brings us to a central idea of linear algebra.\nNote These pages are not concentrating on the mechanics of multiplying or inverting matrices. Those are explained in all courses. My own teaching emphasizes that Ax is a combination of the columns of A. The solution x = A-'b is computed by elimination. Here we explain the deeper idea of a vector space-and especially the particular spaces that control Ax =6. I cannot go into the same detail as in my book on Linear Algebra and Its Applications, where examples and exercises develop the new ideas. Still these pages can be a useful support.\nAll vectors with n components lie in n-dimensional space. You can add them and subtract them and multiply them by any c. (Don't multiply two vectors and never write llx or 1/A). The results x + X and x - X and cx are still vectors in the space.\nHere is the important point:\nThe line of solutions to Ax =0 is a \"subspace\"-a vector space in its own right.\nThe sum x + X has components 6, -3,9-which is another solution. The difference x - X is a solution, and so is 4x. These operations leave us in the subspace.\nThe nullspace consists of all solutions to Ax = 0. It may contain only the zero vector (as in the first example). It may contain a line of vectors (as in the second example). It may contain a whole plane of vectors (Problem 5). In every case x + X and x - X and cx are also in the nullspace. We are assigning a new word to an old idea-the equation x - 2y = 0 has always been represented by a line (its nullspace).\nNow we have 6-dimensional subspaces of an %dimensional vector space.\nNotice that x2 - y =0 does not produce a subspace (a parabola instead). Even the x and y axes together, from xy = 0, do not form a subspace. We go off the axes when we add (1,O) to (0, 1).

The product Ax is a combination of the columns of A-hence the name \"column space\":\nNo choice of x can produce Ax = (0,0, 1). For this A, all combinations of the columns end in a\n. The column space is like the xy plane within xyz space. It is a subspace of m-dimensional space, containing every vector b that is a combination of the columns:\nThe system Ax = b has a solution exactly when b is in the column space.\nWhen A has an inverse, the column space is the whole n-dimensional space. The nullspace contains only x = 0. There is exactly one solution x = A 1 b . This is the good case-and we outline four more key topics in linear algebra.\n1. Basis and dimension of a subspace. A one-dimensional subspace is a line. A plane has dimension two. The nullspace above contained all multiples of (2, -1, 3)-by knowing that \"basis vector\" we know the whole line. The column space was a plane containing column 1 and column 2. Again those vectors are a \"basis\"-by knowing the columns we know the whole column space.\nOur 2 by 3 matrix has three columns: (1,O) and (2, 3) and (0, 1). Those are not a basis for the column space! This space is only a plane, and three vectors are too many. The dimension is two. By combining (1,O) and (0, 1) we can produce the other vector (2, 3). There are only two independent columns, and they form a basis for this column space.\nIn general: When a subspace contains r independent vectors, and no more, those vectors are a basis and the dimension is r. \"Independent\" means that no vector is a combination of the others. In the example, (1,O) and (2, 3) are also a basis. A subspace has many bases, just as a plane has many axes.\n2. Least squares. If Ax = b has no solution, we look for the x that comes closest.\nSection 1 1.4 found the straight line nearest to a set of points.

Equation 2 has u = y = linear. Equation 1is also a special case with u = 1 = constant. But 2 and 1are very different, for the following reason.\nThe compound interest equation y' = cy is growing from inside. The equation y' = s(t) is growing from outside. Where c is a \"growth rate,\" s is a \"source.\" They don't have the same meaning, and they don't have the same units.

The first equation gives a = 1/(1- w2), which multiplies the cosine:\ny = (cos wt)/(1 - w2) solves y\" + y = cos wt.\n(10) General solution Add to this particular solution any solution to y\" + y = 0:\nProblem of resonance When the driving frequency is o = 1, the solution (1 1) becomes meaningless-its denominator is zero. Reason: The natural frequency in cos t and sin t is also 1. A new particular solution comes from t cos t and t sin t.\nThe key to success is to know the form for y. The table displays four right hand sides and the correct y's for any constant-coefficient equation:\nRight hand side Particular solution ekt y = Bek' (same exponent) cos wt or sin o t y = a cos a t + b sin wt (include both) polynomial in t y = polynomial of the same degree ektcos wt or ekt sin wt y = aekt cos wt + bekt sin wt Exception If one of the roots A for free oscillation equals k or ico or 0 or k + iw, the corresponding y in the table is wrong. The proposed solution would give zero on the right hand side. The correct form for y includes an extra t. All particular solutions are computed by substituting into the differential equation.\nApology Constant-coefficient equations hardly use calculus (only e\"). They reduce directly to algebra (substitute y, solve for iland a and b). I find the S-curve from the logistic equation much more remarkable. The nonlinearity of epidemics or heartbeats or earthquakes demands all the calculus we know.

The list of special solutions becomes longer in a course on differential equations. But for most nonlinear problems we enter another worldwhere solutions are numerical and approximate, not exact.\nIn actual practice, numerical methods for dyldt =f (t, y) divide in two groups:\n1. Single-step methods like Euler and Runge-Kutta 2. Multistep methods like Adams-Bashforth The unknown y and the right side f can be vectors with n components. The notation stays the same: the step is At = h, the time t, is nh, and y, is the approximation to the true y at that time. We test the first step, to find y, from yo = 1. The equation is dyldt = y, so the right side is f = y and the true solution is y = et.\nNotice how the first value off (in this case 1) is used inside the second f:\nTEST y, = 1 + +h[l+ (1 + h)] = 1 + h + $h2 At time h the true solution equals eh. Its infinite series is correct through h2 for Improved Euler (a second-order method). The ordinary Euler method yn+ = yn+ hf (t,, y,) is first-order. TEST: y, = 1+ h. Now try Runge-Kutta\n(a fourth-order method):\nNow the first value off is used in the second (for k,), the second is used in the third, and then k3 is used in k,. The programming is easy. Check the accuracy with another test on dyldt = y:\nh2 h3 h4\n=1+ h + -+ -+ -.\nThis answer agrees with eh through h4.\n2 6 24 These formulas are included in the book so that you can apply them directlyfor example to see the S-shape from the logistic equation with f= cy - by2.\nMultistep formulas are simpler and quicker, but they need a single-step method to get started. Here is y, in a fourth-order formula that needs yo, y,, y,, y,. Just shift all indices for y,, y,, and y, + ,:\nh Multistep y4 = y3 + -[55yi - 59y; + 37y; - 9ybl.\n24 The advantage is that each step needs only one new evaluation of y; =f(t,, y,).\nRunge-Kutta needs four evaluations for the same accuracy.\nStability is the key requirement for any method. Now the good test is y' = -y. The solution should decay and not blow up. Section 6.6 showed how a large time step makes Euler's method unstable-the same will happen for more accurate formulas.\nThe price of total stability is an \"implicit method\" like y, = yo + +h(~b+ y;), where the unknown y, appears also in y; .

I can start with the 50 states of the U.S. I ask if Maine is connected to California, by a path through neighboring states. You say yes. I ask for the shortest path (fewest states on the way).\nYou get a map and try all possibilities (not really all-but your answer is right). Then I close all boundaries between states like Illinois and Indiana, because one has an even number of letters and the other has an odd number. Is New York still connected to Washington? You ask what kind of game this is-but I hope you will read on.\nFar from being dumb, or easy, or useless, discrete mathematics asks good questions.\nIt is important to know the fastest way across the country. It is more important to know the fastest way through a phone network. When you call long distance, a quick connection has to be found. Some lines are tied up, like Illinois to Indiana, and there is no way to try every route.\nThe example connects New York to New Jersey (7 letters and 9). Washington is\n' connected to Oregon (10 letters and 6). As you read those words, your mind jumps to this fact-there is no path from New York with 7 letters to Washington with 10.\nSomewhere you must get stuck. There might be a path between all states with an odd number of letters-I doubt it. Graph theory gives a way to find out.\nGRAPHS A model for a large part of finite mathematics is a graph. It is not the graph of y =f(x). The word \"graph\" is used in a totally different way, for a collection of nodes and edges. The nodes are like the 50 states. The edges go between two nodes-the neighboring states. A network of computers fits this model. So do the airline connections between cities. A pair of cities may or may not have an edge between themdepending on flight schedules.

There is an edge to Connecticut (1 1).\nThat touches Massachusetts (13), which is a neighbor of Vermont (7). But we missed Rhode Island, and how do we get back? The order depends on our search methodand two methods are specially important.\nDepth fist search (DFS) \"From the current state, go to one new state if possible.\" But what do we do from Vermont, when New Hampshire (12) is not allowed? The answer is: backtrack to Massachusetts. That becomes the next current state.\nWe label every state as we reach it, to show which state we came from. Then VT has the label MA, and we easily cross back. From MA we go to RI. Then backtrack to MA and CT and NY. At every step I searched for a new state with no success.\nFrom NY we see NJ (9). Finally we are in a corner.\nThe depth first search is ended, by a barrier of even states. Unless we allow Ontario and keep going to Minnesota.\nBreadthfist search (BFS) \"From the current state, add all possible new states to the bottom of the list. But take the next current state from the top of the list.\" There is no need to backtrack.\nFrom NY we reach VT and MA and CT and NJ. What comes next?\nWhere DFS moves from the last possible state, breadth first search moves from thefirst possible state. No move from VT is possible-so we \"scan\" from Massachusetts. We see Rhode Island (barely). That ends BFS.\nThe same six states are reached both ways. Only the order is different. DFS is last in-&st out. BFS is fist in-fist out.

If two edges are removed, we have two trees (a small forest).\nEXAMPLE 3 .411ow an edge between neighboring states only when one state is even and the other is odd.

We will never get to Florida!\nIt is blocked by Alabama and Georgia.\nThe search creates a tree, but not a spanning tree. This graph is not connected.\nAn odd-to-even graph is special and important. It is called \"bipartite,\" meaning two parts. The odd states are in one part, the even states are in the other. All edges go between parts. No edges are within a part.?\nEXAMPLE 4 Is there a \"complete matching\" between 25 even and 25 odd states?\nThis requires neighboring states to be paired off (with no repetition).\nMethod 1 Start pairing them OR CA-AZ, UT-WY, NV-ID, NE-SD, WA-MT.\nWhat about Oregon? Maybe it should have been paired with Idaho. Then Nevada could pair with Arizona. Trial and error goes nowhere fast.\nMethod 2 Think first. The four states CA-OR-WA-NV are even. This whole group is only connected to three odd states (AZ, ID, MT). The matching is impossible.\nThis is Hall's Theorem. In a course on graphs, it would be proved. Our purpose here is to see the ideas and questions in discrete mathematics, more than the proofs.\nTHE GREEDY ALGORITHM Put back all edges between neighboring states. The nodes could be provinces of Canada or states of Australia. If they are countries of Europe-Asia-Africa (or the Americas), we need a new map. The essential thing is the new problem.\nIn a network each edge has a \"length.\" A positive number cij is assigned to the edge from node i to node j. In an economics problem, cij is the cost. In a flow problem it is the capacity, in an electrical circuit it is the conductance. We look for paths that minimize these \"lengths.\" PROBLEM Find the minimum spanning tree. Connect all nodes by a tree with the smallest possible total length.\nThe six cheapest highways connecting seven cities form a minimum spanning tree.

Now it skips 5, which would close a loop. It chooses 6, for total length 23.\nMethod 2 Add edges in order, from shortest to longest. Reject an edge that closes a loop. Several trees grow together (a forest). At the end we have a minimum spanning tree.\nThis variation chooses edge lengths in the order 1,2,3,4,6 (rejecting 5), 7. In our network both methods produce the same tree. When many edges have equal length, there can be many shortest trees.\nThese methods are examples of the Greedy Algorithm: Do the best thing at every step. Don't look ahead. Stick to a decision once it is made. In most network problems the Greedy Algorithm is not optimal-in this spanning tree problem it is.\nMethod 2 looks faster than Method 1.

In the figure, the best path going east has length 1 + 8. There is a new shortest path tree, in which the source plays a special role as the \"root.\" How do we find shortest paths?
