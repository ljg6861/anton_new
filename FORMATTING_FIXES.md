# Formatting Issue Fixes

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve formatting issues in the Anton AI assistant.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Final Answer Tags Leaking into Output
**Problem**: The model was adding `</final_answer>` tags to the end of its output, which should not be visible to users.

**Root Cause**: Internal conversation flow detection logic was using XML-style tags that were leaking into the user interface.

**Solution**: 
- Added `_clean_output_for_user()` method in `ReActAgent` class that removes internal tags before streaming to users
- Maintains internal detection logic for proper conversation flow while cleaning user-visible output
- Handles various tag formats: `<final_answer>`, `</final_answer>`, `Final Answer:`, etc.

### 2. Markdown Formatting Issues
**Problem**: Model output was formatting weirdly in Chainlit, with everything appearing in italics and markdown being replaced.

**Root Cause**: Character-by-character streaming was breaking markdown parsing in the UI, causing partial markdown to be interpreted incorrectly.

**Solution**:
- Replaced character-by-character streaming with whitespace-aware tokenization
- Uses regex splitting to preserve spaces, newlines, and other whitespace
- Streams in larger chunks that maintain markdown integrity
- Preserves formatting for bold, italic, code blocks, links, headers, etc.

### 3. System Prompt Improvements
**Problem**: The model was being encouraged to use XML-style tags in responses.

**Solution**:
- Updated system prompt to explicitly discourage use of HTML/XML tags like `<final_answer>`
- Added guidance to use natural, conversational language
- Emphasized proper markdown formatting instead of XML tags

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

1. **server/agent/react_agent.py**:
   - Added `_clean_output_for_user()` method
   - Modified streaming logic to use `re.split(r'( +|\n+)', content)` for better tokenization
   - Updated system prompt with clearer formatting guidelines

### Testing

Comprehensive tests were added to verify:
- Final answer tag removal in various formats
- Markdown preservation through streaming
- Whitespace and newline preservation
- Chainlit compatibility
- Combined functionality (both fixes working together)

All tests pass with 100% success rate.

## Before vs After

### Before (Issues):
```
Output: "Here's your solution: **Bold text**</final_answer>"
Streaming: ['H', 'e', 'r', 'e', "'", 's', ' ', 'y', 'o', 'u', 'r', ...]
Result: Broken markdown, visible tags, italics formatting issues
```

### After (Fixed):
```
Output: "Here's your solution: **Bold text**"
Streaming: ["Here's", " your", " solution:", " **Bold", " text**"]
Result: Clean output, preserved markdown, no visible tags
```

## Verification

The fixes resolve all three issues mentioned:
1. ✅ No more `</final_answer>` tags in output
2. ✅ Markdown formatting preserved correctly
3. ✅ No more unwanted italics in Chainlit

The internal logic for conversation flow detection continues to work properly while providing clean user output.
